1955^The Southern Expanse
1956^Across the sea to the south of Imperia is a dry, arid land with a coastline dotted with sparkling cities. Not much is known of the peoples in this desert land, it is rumored to be ruled by a corrupt family strong in the ways of magic.  This area is a source of much concern for Imperia, as ship building has never been something its people have done well and fears of an invasion by sea make the rounds every few years.  Many sailors have returned from voyages telling tales of men who could summon fire from the ground and bend it to their will.  Trade between the lands is rare, whether stories of pirates are true or just a way to keep business controlled by a few merchants is unknown.
1957^Imperia
1958^The central empire in Gladius, long the aggressor in the region during their expansion years.  They fought and conquered much of the land in the fertile central valley.  With a strong agriculture and large standing army, Imperia has prospered and become almost civilized.  The military culture is very strong in Imperia, years of war and conquest has left them with large numbers of well-trained troops.  In an effort to channel the energies of such a strong populous, the ruling senate instituted the national games.  These tournaments pit warrior against warrior, school against school.  For all its civilization it is still a dangerous world, the northern coast of Imperia is untamed and it is rumored that monsters can still be found amongst the rough hills and caves that line the sea.

1981^Home of the three Barbarian Kings, their land is harsh and rugged filled with deep forest and snow covered mountains.  The Kings fought for many years with Imperia, losing large amounts of the lowlands to them.  It wasn’t until the Nomads of the east arrived on the scene and forced Imperia into a two front war that the tide began to turn.  Imperia pulled back into the valley and erected a huge earthen wall some 40 miles long at the border of the two kingdoms.  A strained truce has existed between the two lands for the past few decades, and trade between them is just beginning.  The culture of the Barbarians has a deep history of magic, and the three kings take serious counsel from the order of Galdr who live at the far northern reaches of the kingdom.  It is rumored that some warriors from the kingdom have been granted strange powers over animal kind and are even believed to have the power to shape shift.
1982^These endless and barren plains were long uninhabited, but all that changed some 50 years ago with the arrival of the Nomads.  With well-trained warriors mounted on horseback the Nomad tribes were a real threat to Imperia and its inviting central valley.  It was only the sheer size of Imperia’s army that has kept back the Nomadic Cavalry, that and the limited access the Nomads have through a few mountain passes.  It is not known how far the Nomads power extends but they seem to have access to goods from many far away lands.  A few brave weapons dealers have been trading with the Nomads of late, strange and powerful items and weapons can be purchased from them and some have been showing up in the games in Imperia.
1983^Altahrun
1984^Belfort
1985^Belfort, originally a military stronghold against the north is built along a wall bordering Nordagh.  Warriors left behind to serve Imperia and protect it from invasion by those across the border founded it. About the same size as Pirgos, the citizens are anything but refined. There is a distinct class separation in Belfort with descendants of famous Centurions, Legionnaires and other war heroes past living the high life while seemingly everyone else just gets by. Fighting for entertainment has always been a staple in Belfort and continues on to this day. The arena in Belfort is in the center of town and is frequented by commoners and those from the north who've made it across the border, either legally or otherwise.

3227^An assortment of Imperia's less reputable gladiators, lead by Galverg.
3228^High Krigare School
3229^This school split off from the Krigare School when the latter broke tradition and started incorporating styles from outside of Nordagh.
3230^Nogai Open Series
3231^Burning Statues
3232^Scum of the Earth
3233^The Scum of the Earth doesn't actually refer to a formal organization of any kind, instead being the generic catch phrase for those criminals allowed to work off their sentences by competing in the games.
3234^Fliuch Home Guard
3235^Blitzing Berserkers
3236^Fliuch's militia and police force occasionally competes in the local games.
3237^Blitzing Berserkers
3238^Blitzing Berserkers Hi
3239^The Harbingers
3240^Long Range Combat Mya
3241^The Harbingers are the bodyguard of the Galdr, the mysterious witch-women of Nordagh.  Younger Galdr lead these squads of warriors with a precision unknown in traditional military doctrine.
3242^Long Range Mya
3243^Long Range Pu
3244^Supersize It Gu
3245^Massive Gu
3246^United Packs
3247^As part of an agreement between the Druids of Sloan Forest and the leader of the Great Pack designed to keep travelers in the forest uneaten, the Sloan Forest wolves send their most incorrigibly aggressive pack members to compete in the games.
3248^The Sylvan Ones
3249^The denizens of Sloan Forest have a strong connection to nature, allowing for a deeper level of communication between species.  This school allows the forest's inhabitants to fly the home colors in the local games.  The thrill of battle is by no means exclusive to humans.
3250^Sloan Defense Brigade
3251^Even a population as spread out as that of the Sloan Forest needs a militia and police force.  Competing in the games keeps them sharp.
3252^Liquid Swords Hya
3253^Glade Masters
3254^The Sloan Forest imparts a certain toughness upon its inhabitants, forcing them to adapt to the often harsh environment.  The Glade Masters are the result of combining that toughness with training from some of the world's best gladiators.
3255^Nordagh Ya
3256^Hit and Run Ya
3257^Lightweights Gwa
3258^Cretin Rya
3259^Krigare School
3260^The Krigare family has maintained a proud military legacy for generations.  Recently, upon the resurgence of arena combat, the clan's patriarch decided to include warriors from outside Nordagh in the family school.  This caused a rift with his younger brother, who split off to form the High Krigare School.
3261^Ham It Up Ku
3262^Crowd's Favor Ku
3263^Morder Tribe
3264^The Morder Tribe is the most vicious and anarchic of the berserker tribes, spreading violence and chaos wherever possible.  The games may be the only thing keeping the rest of Nordagh from stamping them out in self-defense.
3265^Leende Tribe
3266^For a group of bloodthirsty maniacs, the Leende Tribe is good company.  They alone of the berserker tribes are allowed to compete outside of Mördare.
3267^Death after Death
3268^All of the gladiators ever to perish in Mördare's Den are known to rise there on any night in which there is a crowd to watch them.  They will fight amongst themselves, and any of the living willing to face them.
3269^Uvanlig's Motley
3270^Uvanlig the Satyr was an infamous traveling jester.  His jokes and limericks could infuriate even the most placid crowds. His skill in surviving these situations served him so well when he was sentenced to the arena for disturbing the peace that he decided to switch professions, starting the strangest school in all of Nordagh.
3271^Dragonheart Militia
3272^In addition to the usual police and defense responsibilites, the Dragonheart Militia is charged with protecting Mördare's Den from those that would use its magic for evil.  The arcane nature of many of the events there provides ideal practice.
3273^Children of Mjolnir
3274^The Children of Mjolnir are Nordagh's elite shock troops.  Highly skilled, well equipped, and possessing almost super-human fortitude, the Children could dominate in the games, if they weren't focused on more serious matters most of the time.
3275^Heroes vs. Belfort Local
3276^Vargen Irregulars
3277^There isn't much reason to invade Vargen, and the locals don't cause much trouble, so some people think that the Vargen Irregulars are merely an excuse for its members to compete in the games.
3278^The Elders
3279^This Yeti clan was here long before humanity crawled its way into the mountains to settle Vargen.  A noble and misunderstood people, the Yeti compete in the games to improve relations with the tiny humans.
3280^Demo School
3281^A motley assortment of gladiators fighting out of the city of Pirgos.
3282^The Pack
3283^Centuries ago, the cold forced the wolves near Vargen to seek shelter in the town.  It could have been a bloodbath, but local barbarians were able to shift shape and communicate with the poor, freezing wolves, and a lasting truce was formed.  Now, the games let them play with their human friends.
3284^Test your skills against some of Pirgos' local populous.
3285^Local recruits are ready for your school!
3286^Battle the School of Lameticus!

3345^Let me see your wares.
3346^I'd like to hear some of your lore.
3347^Wonderful!  You know we serve the royal family, yes?  We pride ourselves on carrying only the best items.  I'm sure you'll find something to your liking.
3348^Oh, I do enjoy a good conversation.  What would you like to hear about?
3349^Are you here to shop or talk?
3350^Shop.
3351^Talk.
3352^Ok, but I only carry Imperial items.  I hope that's what you're looking for...
3353^I see...  What do you want to hear about?
3354^Shall I suit you up, or chat you up?
3355^Suit us up!
3356^Let's chat.
3357^Excellent.  I'll make you twice the school you were yesterday!  Step into my shop.
3358^Straight from the forums of Caltha, Tecis brings the news to you, heh heh.  What would you like to know?
3359^Would you like to shop or talk?
3360^Everything I get is from the mines.  Who knows, you might find something rare...
3361^What shall we talk about?
3362^Buy, sell or trade, that's my business.  But I never could say no to a little gossip...  What'll it be, friends?
3363^Let's do business.
3364^Let's gossip.
3365^You won't find a wider selection of items in all of Nordagh!  Take a look around.
3366^You'd never believe the amount of gossip that comes through this town.  Lookin' to hear anything in particular?
3367^Equipment or advice, which do you seek?
3368^Equipment.
3369^Advice.
3370^I try to get a little something for everyone.  I hope you find what you need here.
3371^Ok, but don't forget to check my inventory before you head into The Den.  What's on your mind?
3372^The Duel
3373^Great!  Let's talk!  Tell me, what do you want to know about?
3374^Are you here to exchange money or stories?
3375^Money.
3376^Stories.
3377^I see.  Yes, quite.  Sometimes money speaks louder than words, am I right?
3378^Roanor's open league is decidedly different than most, as opponents face one another one at a time.  Only the most skilled fighters can defeat all comers.
3379^What brings you to the King's private store?
3380^We need equipment.
3381^We seek information.
3382^The King himself decides on our stock.  Please, step inside.
3383^Information about what?
3384^YES!  What do you need?!  I know you need fire items.  Ahh...  Fire.  EXURO!!  Or did you just come to talk to me?  Ha!
3385^Um...  We're looking for items.
3386^Yes, Sciras, we came to talk to you...
3387^Oh I LOVE a school who worships Exuro.  This is so exciting!  I will set you UP!
3388^Yeah, right.  I'm sure you traveled all this way just to visit your good pal Sciras...  Well, at any rate, let's talk!  Tell me, care to chat about The Eye?
3389^Ahead of the Pack
3390^The unforgiving terrain surrounding Vargen long ago forced even the sturdy wolf packs to seek the town's warmth.  The packs get along well enough with the villagers, but sometimes they need to vent their feral side in the games.  Once they're riled up, however, it's best for all concerned to keep the action going until they tire of it.
3391^...and what would you be looking for today...
3392^We're here to shop.
3393^Yes, of course you are...
3394^Information is it?  I see.  How can Cresus ... enlighten you?
3395^Shopping or talking today for you?
3396^Mile-High Circuit
3397^Let's talk.
3398^If anything about Vargen could be called a draw, it would be the Mile-High Circuit.  Fans will sometimes follow their favorite schools to the Fjord of the Fallen in large groups, as the otherwise uncrowded arena gives them a great view of the action.
3399^Shopping is what we do.  I have some item.
3400^Hordes of the North
3401^Ok.  But then you buy.
3402^The Children of Mjolnir are  the most elite shock troops in Nordagh.  While they compete in the arena to keep their skills sharp, their focus is the battlefield.  Their home league  reflects this:  No breaks are given between waves.  Few schools last long enough to earn the Children's respect, and none have yet lasted to the end.
3403^Trial of the Elders
3404^This Yeti tribe started dominating at the local games recently.  Nobody knows why they fight, but folks think it's likely that they win because  they're big, hairy and really strong.  Their arrival puts other events on hold, as the Yeti set up camp in the arena itself.  Someday, if they can be beaten, the mysteries of the Yeti will be revealed.
3405^League of Redemption
3406^As Nordagh's metropolitan center, Fliuch is also the location of the regional magistrates.  Sentences for minor crimes are often waived if the criminal is willing to perform in the  games.  The League of Redemption isn't the most glamorous introduction to the games, but it can be a great place for a new school to build some notoriety.
3407^Arena Certification
3408^Almost anyone can swing a sword or an axe, but there's more to arena combat than that.  Participants in Nordagh's  games must first prove themselves knowledgeable in the ways of the gladiator.  This league will let one earn the Talisman of Travel for Nordagh.
3409^Lightning Circuit
3410^Speed is at the core of Nordagh's military might.  Unburdened by heavy armor, the warriors of the North are agile and quick.  The Lightning Circuit celebrates this tradition.
3411^Contest of the Free Peoples
3412^This is The Fen's most popular league.  All the big names will usually compete in at least one round when they're in town,  yet the locals have a chance to shine, as well.  The league officers are under pressure to keep the crowds cheering, so they won't let any unknowns fight in this league.
3413^The primitive Berserker tribes of Nordagh regard Mördare as a holy place.  While many might view arena combat as an intrusion into a religious pilgrimage, the tribes find it quite convenient, as their religion revolves around the ecstasy of battle.  Outsiders are invited to join in the celebration, and the ceremonies are treated like any other arena event.
3414^The Dead of Night
3415^Centuries ago, arena combat was much deadlier than it is now.  In Mördare, the dragon's bones have trapped the souls of the dead.  At night, if there's a crowd to watch them, they rise, first taking on all comers, then fighting amongst themselves until only one still stands.
3416^The Wyrd
3417^Perhaps it's the constant reminder provided by the giant dead dragon within which the arena lies, but spectators at Mördare have developed a keen taste for the supernatural.  This trend has proved so popular that the arena now offers an entire league in which humans are not allowed to compete.
3418^Dragonheart Open
3419^Mördare's open league is arguably the most varied in Nordagh.  Between the stranger folk drawn in by the magical nature of the arena and the foreigners drawn by the chance to fight something unique, one never knows what one might have to face in any given fight.
3420^League of Northern Pride
3421^The High Krigare school separated from the venerable Krigare school when the latter broke with tradition by including warriors from outside Nordagh.  The League of Northern Pride is their attempt to show how the games should be fought, Nordagh-style.
3422^Kingdom Open
3423^The arena at Orin's Keep is the most advanced in Nordagh.   The Kingdom Open is the response to popular pressure for the arena to see more use.  While infrequent, these competitions draw Nordagh's finest, as well as some of the better gladiators from outside the kingdom.
3424^Dreas Open League
3425^This league is the Sloan Forest's biggest draw, at least in terms of gladiatorial combat.  Teams from all over Nordagh, and sometimes even further away, compete for sylvan-themed prize packages, and a surprising amount of notoriety, given the remoteness of the arena location.
3426^Man and Beast
3427^The Council in Sloan Forest likes to promote cooperation between mankind and the forest's less civilized denizens.   Teams entering battles in this league must be comprised of at least half beasts.
3428^To the Wolves
3429^The Sloan Council was able to negotiate with the grand pack leader to keep the wolves from harassing local herds.  As part of the agreement, the wolves send a pack or two to Stadium Dreas, to compete in the games.  Only the most militant packs go, and as a result, the pack leaders tend to be very formidable.
3430^Fight the Bear
3431^The bears of the Sloan Forest enjoy playing with the smaller creatures they meet.  As the results are often indistinguishable from those of being mauled in anger, the Sloan Forest Council thought it best to give the bears an outlet for this sort of behavior.  So far, the bears seem quite pleased with their league.
3432^Circle of Elites Tier 1
3433^The Circle of Elites is Nordagh's answer to the High Tournament.  Although winning Circle events does little to get a school closer to Caltha, the increased notoriety that results can make Nordagh's crowds take notice.  A school must qualify in Roanor, then conquer all Tier 1 events to progress to Tier 2.
3434^Circle of Elites Tier 2
3435^Circle of Elites Tier 1
3436^Circle of Elites Tier 2
3437^Circle Championship
3438^While the Circle of Elites exists almost outside of the scramble to get to Caltha, some argue that even the regional tournament is less important than the Circle Championship.  Only at the High Tournament itself is competiton more fierce, and some even question that, because the Children of Mjolnir can't qualify for Caltha if they won't leave Nordagh.
3439^Circle of Elites Qualifier
3440^Circle of Elites Tier 2

3446^This league must be conquered in order for a visiting school to compete in any other Nordagh leagues.
3447^Farewell travelers!
3448^Anytime you've got some Deanr burning a hole in your purse, you know where to come.
3449^Good luck in the arena.  You'll need it if you're heading north.
3450^Give 'em hell, gladiators!
3451^Thank you very much.  Come again.
3452^Thanks for Stoppin' over!
3453^Good luck out there, youngsters.
3454^I wish you well on your journey.
3455^The king's blessing goes with you, young prince and princess.  Good luck.
3456^The King blesses you and your school, Usus.  Fare thee well.
3457^Don't be caught unawares!  Remember, The Eye ... sees all.  YES!
3458^Good day, friends...  May your adventure prove to be ... prosperous.
3459^Bye.
3460^What may I help you with today?
3461^Do you have any gossip?
3462^Well, do you see anything you like?  In my shop, I mean...
3463^I see.  Well, let's just sit down and get to know each other...
3464^Don't be a stranger, now.
3465^Do you want to shop or what?
3466^Yes, we'd like to shop.
3467^Good.
3468^If you insist...
3469^Goodbye.
3470^So, shall we gossip, or are you just here to peruse my goods?
3471^We're perusing.
3472^Take your time whilst perusing, my friends.
3473^Oooh, I just love a good gossip session.
3474^Bye-bye.
3475^What are you interested in today?
3476^Great!  Come on inside.
3477^Well then, what should we talk about?
3478^See you around.

3483^Very well, I'll put a kettle on...
3484^May the spirits of the forest guide you along your way.
3485^Then shopping it is.  Looking for anything in particular?
3486^Good luck on your travels.
3487^Are you interested in weapons, armor and accessories or are you here to chew the fat with good 'ol Duger.  That's me.
3488^Let's shop today.
3489^Why don't we "chew the fat."
3490^Excellent choice.  I've got plenty of items that I'm sure will impress even seasoned gladiators like yourself.
3491^Most exciting.  Talking with real-life gladiators...  What's your topic of choice?
3492^Good luck gladiators!  Remember, I'll buy Nordagh stuff at a nice price, so don't be strangers!

3839^After we won the Great War, the Imperials built this wall to keep the savages from the North where they belong.
3840^The city started as a military encampment whose responsibility it was to guard against possible invasion from Nordagh.
3841^After some time, retired Centurions and Legionnaires moved into the area and brought an air of class to a border town, which in my opinion, is just asking for trouble, being so close to Nordagh...
3842^Once the noble blood of those who served in the great war started dying off, in came the likes of me.  The riffraff, as the Senate would have you believe.
3843^We lower class run this town!
3844^The descendants of those "War Heroes" live the high life, never wanting for anything, while we the downtrodden, just get by.
3845^The only thing that keeps us going sometimes is the arena.
3846^You’ve noticed, I’m sure, that the arena is in the center of town right?  Well, it didn’t always used to be that way.  Before the arena was 'built,' there was a bustling town square where everyone met to trade goods and peddle their wares.
3847^One day during the construction of a new theatre (one of the Senate’s poor attempts at cleaning up this town), the soil became unstable and the ground collapsed under the workers' feet, revealing ruins of an ancient city long buried by the sands of time.
3848^This was about 75 years ago, I’d say...
3849^After the debris from the collapse of the city center was cleared out, the walls and ruins that were unearthed seemed a natural place for Belfort’s first arena.
3850^The Senate thought this was a blessing.
3851^Take the poor and dispossessed and toss them into the arena and let the gods sort them out.
3852^Gates were put up where caverns were revealed and beasts were kept hungry for blood behind them.  The rim of the arena was lined with spikes even though it was nearly impossible to climb out of the arena once you were thrown in.
3853^A wooden fence lines the rim, keeping spectators safely outside the arena, where they belong.  There’s always something going on in this arena.  In fact, you can usually hear the crowds from dusk till dawn.
3854^Centuries ago, Pirgos was founded as Bartonus--named after the self proclaimed Lord of the city.  Bartonus was a man fed up with the business of Caltha and so decided to venture out on his own.
3855^He and a number of followers traveled forth and ended up founding this city.  At first, it was a small agricultural trade town, proud of its fine sense of class.
3856^The artisans flourished and all the finer things in life were cherished--gladiatorial combat being no exception.
3857^But this wouldn’t last.  Soon, Bartonus, hungry for power, started taking obscene pleasure in the games.  He liked to see innocents killed in the arena...  Even women and children were brought to the slaughter.
3858^Occasionally, Bartonus himself entered the arena, striking down the beggars and the poor.
3859^His reign wouldn’t last long, as the revolutionary war of 1124, under the leadership of a valiant warrior Lameticus, stripped Bartonus of his power--and his life.
3860^Now, the only reminder of Bartonus’ tyranny is the arena.  It stands not only to remind us of the hatred of those like Bartonus, but also to remind us of the valiance of the people who stood against him.
3861^Pirgos now has a very calm and peaceful air about it.  This is why I, Cresus, choose to live here.
3862^After Lameticus led his successful revolution against Bartonus, he and his followers made their way to the arena that Bartonus had soiled all too often with innocent blood.
3863^Alone in the center of the arena, his followers on the periphery drunk with victory, Lameticus declared Bartonus ever free from tyranny and gave it a new name, Pirgos.  Planting his standard before him, it is said that the very earth shook.
3864^The intensity of these few silent moments of glory was immediately castrated when a straggling counter-revolutionary ran into the arena and thrust a gladius through Lameticus’ spine.
3865^In his last effort against tyranny, the dying Lameticus swung about, drew his sword and slew the deviant in one fell swoop.
3866^The arena that was intended to be closed and torn down became a monument to the power of the people and over time became a place to settle disputes--many of which resulted in bloodshed.
3867^It seemed that the bloody history of the square had a life of its own.  The more fights and arguments, the more people stopped to watch.
3868^It wasn’t long before the city was charging money for these duels to help with the upkeep of the arena and now, centuries later, the Pirgos Open Arena is a major venue for the leagues.
3869^Cro Beska is the only known city in all of Imperia that the Mongrels call home.  After its discovery, most Imperials stopped exploring the surrounding region due to the violent nature of the Mongrels.
3870^The only Imperials that stayed were the ones brave enough to set up a trade system with the creatures.  You see, they don’t understand the wealth of what’s in their mines.
3871^We trade with them what we don’t want and end up living very richly because of it.
3872^Of course, my husband and I live on the outskirts of town.  Even though we live in peace with the Mongrels most of the time, it’s not wise to go into town ill prepared.
3873^The Mongrels have control over the city, and if they ever realized this, we would all be in a lot of trouble.
3874^Seeing the way that we the civilized live, the Mongrels have built an arena of their own where the brutality of the gladiatorial games is taken to a new level.
3875^Measures are taken by both humans and semi-humans to make sure that access by outsiders to fight in their arena is allowed, and safe passage into and out of the arena is often provided.
3876^The only humans to stay in Cro Beska proper are prisoners of the Mongrels.  Viewed as a commodity, these prisoners are often forced to fight in the games and are awarded as prizes, the poor souls.
3877^The Mongrel’s Maw is located on the other side of Cro Beska.  It is also on the outskirts of town, but is positioned so that you have to go through town to get to it.
3878^I think it’s a sort of intimidation game the Mongrels like to play with their potential victims.
3879^The Mongrel’s Maw was built by the Mongrels, also its primary audience.  It was built to mimic what the Mongrels glimpsed of the civilized world, but any fame that the Maw has gotten is purely for disrespectful reasons.
3880^It was launched into infamy on the day that 100 slaves were decimated by an Ogre before the Ogre finally got bored and fell asleep in the middle of the arena.
3881^The remaining slaves were given to families of Mongrels, to do with as they pleased.
3882^After this event, the arena was doomed to carry with it an unwholesome reputation.  If you’re seeking a challenge, the Maw is the place for you to go,
3883^Those Mongrels fight very dirty.
3884^Oh...  You’d like to hear about the wonderful city of Orus...  Well, I can tell you a bit about that.  Everyone in Orus is here for two reasons.  Obviously, The Eye is a big reason.
3885^I mean, seeing gladiators go at it while surrounded by fire and brimstone!  You’d be a fool not to want to see shows like that!  Another draw to Orus are the hot springs at the base of Aduro.
3886^That’s the volcano--Aduro.
3887^And the spas!  There are many spas in Orus, so if you’re looking for some pampering after a hard battle, you’ll want to head to the base of the mountain and take a night in the spas.
3888^They have masseuses too--and they sure do know how to work a body.  (That’s what I’ve been told, at least).
3889^So, anyway, Orus became popular among the high class of Imperia, as well as rich foreigners traveling the region.
3890^If you haven’t been into the city center, you really should go.  It’s very beautiful.
3891^Of course, most everyone in the city worships Exuro in their own way, as well they should, and iconography of his glorious image and his avatar are everywhere you look.
3892^That’s why I moved here from Syrna!  If it weren’t for the citizens’ adoration of Exuro, our arena would probably be a lot different...
3893^Thank the Gods it’s not!  And so, living here, high up in the Cardis mountains, under the shadow of Aduro, and Exuro who rules over it, is the place for me!
3894^Ahh, The Eye.
3895^EXURO’S EYE!
3896^Boy, you’ve come to the right person if you want to hear about The Eye, I will tell you!
3897^Exuro’s Eye is probably the most dangerous arena in Imperia--and not just because of the kinds of fights held in it either.  The battlefield of The Eye is actually nestled inside the cone of Aduro!
3898^That’s the volcano, you know--Aduro.
3899^Ok, yeah, it’s true that Aduro hasn’t erupted in about 150 years, but you know what they say, "Keep your eye on The Eye!"  You’ve heard that before, right?
3900^Is that what they say?  I haven't heard that before.
3901^No?  Oh.  Well...  Where was I?
3902^Oh yeah!  Throughout the playfield are fissures and pools of lava which sometimes, if you’re lucky, spew forth fire and lava onto the gladiators!
3903^And even though they’re about two heads higher than the floor of the arena, it’s not uncommon for the audience to sometimes be hit either.  Exciting isn’t it!
3904^The charge for admission to The Eye is typically less than that of other arenas in the region, but for good reason, you know!
3905^Things don’t always go as planned when Exuro is deciding your fate!
3906^I could go on for quite a while about The Eye, but I’ll let you get back to your mission at hand.  I would love to see your school compete under the gaze of the almighty Exuro.
3907^Until then, I shall sleep under its glow and dream of a fiery Armageddon!  Ha!  Just kidding.
3908^Curious about our past, are ya?  Well, as I’m sure you know, you’re standing in the Capital of Imperia.  Since we’re located on the Hatteus River, we started out as a port town, exporting our biggest crop, olives.
3909^Hundreds of years old, the Senate of Caltha was founded by the wealthiest farmers of the area.
3910^Interested in getting more money in their pockets, they negotiated trade agreements with those as close as the other fledgling cities of Imperia, and as far away as the booming mine towns of the Southern Expanse.
3911^Over time, the Senate moved out of the countryside and into the city center.  They had less and less to do with farming and eventually fell into power over the people of Caltha.
3912^Their example had great impact on other cities in Imperia and soon, each city had a Senate of their own.
3913^Each of these Senates turned to the Senate of Caltha for guidance and this is how Caltha became the governing Capital of Imperia.
3914^The people have prospered under the Senate’s governance now for nearly 1000 years, and Caltha benefits from this prosperity more than any other city.
3915^The High Tournaments are held here--I even fought in them once myself, you know--and these draw people from all over the lands, opening up trade routes and ultimately strengthening the arm of Imperia.
3916^In my opinion, the Arena at Caltha is the pinnacle of gladiatorial glory, perhaps only surpassed by ascension to the kingdom of heaven.
3917^The Arena was originally commissioned by the former head of the Senate, Acastus, a great visionary.  Planning alone took 15 designers nearly a decade to complete.
3918^Final construction of this feat of engineering wasn’t even completed until some 20 years after Acastus’ death.  Only 3 of the original designers were still alive to witness the unveiling of their epic masterwork.
3919^Nearly 2000 slaves died in its making.  400 beasts and several small villages also perished in the wake of its construction.
3920^At the time, building resources were so scarce in Imperia that some say the massive campaigns against Nordagh were initially motivated out of the need for more stone and wood, simply to complete the Arena.
3921^Even with so much blood already staining the Coliseum, the populace was more than ready to support the blood-sport within and the Arena at Caltha has become the jewel in the crown of the Imperial Empire.
3922^With seating for over 30,000 spectators, pilgrims come from far and wide to fill this cathedral of violence, flavored with statues, columns and pennants.
3923^It is truly a sight to behold.  However, it’s not easy getting into the High Tournaments.  Only the best gladiators in the land are even considered.
3924^And success in the Arena at Caltha amounts to far more than mere prize money...  The cheering crowd can be a powerful inspiration and many gladiators have ridden its wave to victory.

3944^Actually, nevermind.
3945^Oh yes, The Oasis has always been a popular establishment for the Royal Family in Akar An.  Why, even the Queen herself came to my store once!
3946^Really?  The Queen came to your store in person?
3947^I don't believe that for a second!
3948^Well...
3949^Actually it <b>was</B> before I owned it.  But she's been within these walls, mark my words.

3951^Archer Nya Series
3952^So, you’re interested in local history, eh?  I think this old dog has a tale or two left in him.  Where shall I begin...
3953^Well first off, you should know that Fliuch is, and always has been, Nordagh’s most prosperous city, even if its citizens are a bit...  rough around the edges, heh heh.
3954^A long time ago, Fliuch was established as a trade town, but as more and more people moved into the city, fewer and fewer outsiders breached its walls, carrying out their business just ouside of the borders.
3955^Fliuch has become a marsh town you see, and is surrounded by bogs and lakes.  We had to build bridges and walkways through the dense moors in order to keep the trade routes open.
3956^And the bridges work nicely, as we are able to keep track of everyone who comes and goes.  Because of this, Fliuch has never felt the pain of war like so many other cities in Nordagh...
3957^Somehow though, Nordagh has gotten a rough reputation among the known regions.  Heh heh.
3958^To natives, though, Fliuch is a wonderful place to live and visit!  It has the best taverns, entertainment and shops, if I do say so myself.  Being a trade town, we often have items that aren’t usually found in this region.
3959^Muscle rules in this town though, and they say that if you don’t like something the way it is, you’d better change it yourself or learn to live with it.
3960^The arena we have here in Fliuch is appropriately named "The Fen".  Just looking around, you’ll see how it got its name.
3961^I could tell you that our arena is the best in all of Nordagh, but I would be doing you and your school an injustice if I didn’t spell it out for you straight.
3962^The Fen is little more than a gloomy, smelly, dank mudpit that could just as readily be used as a pig pen (and often is during the off season), as for fighting.
3963^When you fight there, you’ll notice that weathered wooden planks ring the arena and also define its shape, which changes from year to year.
3964^Believe it or not, the planks are there less to prevent the fighters from escaping than it is to keep the crowd from joining in!  You know us Northerners--can’t turn our backs on a good fight!  Heh heh.
3965^The mud in the arena is always wet with blood and rain, and it’s not surprising to find rocks and bones sticking up from the packed earth below the layer of dredge.
3966^Now, I love the games as much as the next person, but our arena is basically just a good place for people to kill each other and others to stand and watch.  What can I say, we in Nordagh are a simple people.  Hah heh.
3967^Roanor where I live is a strong city.  We have Roanor here, on the other side of the wall, Belfort.  We have no trees inside city, but there are other trees in Nordagh.
3968^We started to be a city when people wanted to be in Imperia and had to wait at the wall.  But finally we stopped waiting and made us a city.  And we have much proud because of it.
3969^We make money all alone ourselves by getting items from Imperia without Imperia knowing.  Some people smuggle it.  Most people smuggle it.
3970^The other people are an army.  People who want to be in an army to protect us from Imperia are here too.  Imperia doesn’t like it, our army.
3971^But we stay here and they stay there and we live.  You know?  We live.
3972^The Pit?  There’s not much to tell.  They dug in the ground like the peoples in Belfort did, but they didn’t find stuff.
3973^But they started fight anyway.  Now peoples come here to fight and to watch other peoples fight.  Sometimes they put animals to fight.
3974^That’s my favorite.
3975^It costs money to fight in The Pit, and to go to watch the fight.  People who fight can make money.  And then I sell them stuff.
3976^You come back after you fight.

4087^The marketplace in the center of Belfort was a busy, bustling meeting place for all Imperials traveling the land.  But what those who built it didn't know was that it was constructed on unstable soil, concealing the ruins of an ancient city buried by the sands of time, just meters below.  After the city center collapsed some 75 years past, it was turned into a gladiatorial arena, inspired by the walls of the ruins it revealed.  Minimal work was done to make this locale prime territory for the fights, as the ancient foundations created a nearly complete fighting space on their own.  Gates were put up where caverns were revealed and beasts were kept hungry and thirsty for blood behind them.  The rim of the arena was lined with spikes more for decoration than for practical use, because the high walls were so sheer that it was nearly impossible to climb out of the arena once you were thrown in.  A wooden fence now lines the precipice, holding at bay a constantly jeering and excited crowd.  Nearly around the clock, the noise of the crowds can be heard, as this city-sponsored arena is in almost constant use.

4119^Belfort Arena
4120^The marketplace in the center of Belfort was a busy, bustling meeting place for all Imperials traveling the land. But those who built it didn't know that the marketplace was constructed on the ruins of an ancient city buried meters below. Many years ago the city center collapsed revealing the walls of the ruins. Inspired by the ancient constructs, it was turned into a gladiatorial arena. Minimal work was done to make this locale prime territory for the fights, as the ancient foundations created an excellent fighting space on their own. Gates were built over the caverns where beasts were kept hungry for blood. The rim of the arena was lined with spikes more for decoration that for practical use, because the walls were so sheer that it was nearly impossible to climb out of the arena. A wooden fence now lines the precipice, holding the crowd at bay. The noise of the crowds can be heard around the clock, as this city-sponsored arena is in almost constant use.

4128^The Pirgos Open Arena
4129^After the revolutionary Lameticus led his successful revolution against local tyrant Bartonus, he and his followers made their way to the arena that Bartonus had soiled all too often with innocent blood.  Alone in the center of the arena, his followers on the periphery drunk with victory, Lameticus declared Bartonus ever free from tyranny and gave it a new name, Pirgos.  Planting his standard before him, it is said that the very earth shook.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of these few silent moments of glory was immediately castrated when a straggling counter-revolutionary ran into the arena and thrust a gladius through Lameticus’ spine.  In his last effort against tyranny, the dying Lameticus swung about, drew his sword and slew the deviant in one fell swoop.\r\n\r\nThe arena that was intended to be closed and torn down became a monument to the power of the people and over time became a place to settle disputes--many of which resulted in bloodshed.  It seemed that the bloody history of the square had a life of its own.  The more fights and arguments, the more people stopped to watch.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before the city was charging money for these duels to help with the upkeep of the arena and now, centuries later, the Pirgos Open Arena is a major venue for the leagues.
4130^Tell us about you, Cresus.
4131^Have you always lived here?
4132^The battles in the Pirgos Open Arena are like no other in the region.  They tend to be a bit smaller in scale, but carry with them a great deal of noteriety.
4133^Before moving on, you would do well to try and complete as many battles here as you can.
4134^Not just for popularity, but for the experience.  In fact, what tier is your school?
4135^We're Semi-Pro, why?
4136^Ah, yes...  Of course, you would be, wouldn't you...
4137^Cresus was just curious, because Pirgos is known for its Ranged League.  Heroes are made and destroyed in that league.
4138^I myself never attend the battles, as their brutality reminds me--
4139^Well, once you reach Pro, you might be wise to try the Ranged League.

4261^Tell us a little about Pirgos.
4262^Tell us about the city.
4263^The History of Pirgos
4264^Centuries ago, Pirgos was founded as Bartonus--named after the self proclaimed Lord of the city.  Bartonus was a man fed up with the business of Caltha and so decided to venture out on his own.  He and a number of followers traveled forth and ended up founding the city.  At first, it was a small agricultural trade town, proud of its fine sense of class.  The artisans flourished and all the finer things in life were cherished--gladiatorial combat being no exception.\r\n\r\nBut this wouldn’t last.  Soon, Bartonus, hungry for power, started taking obscene pleasure in the games.  He liked to see innocents killed in the arena... Even women and children were brought to the slaughter.  Occasionally, Bartonus himself entered the arena, striking down the beggars and the poor.\r\n\r\nHis reign wouldn’t last long, as the revolutionary war of 1124, under the leadership of a valiant warrior Lameticus, stripped Bartonus of his power--and his life.\r\n\r\nNow, the only reminder of Bartonus’ tyranny is the arena.  It stands not only as a reminder of the hatred of those like Bartonus, but also as a reminder of the valiance of the people who stood against him.  Pirgos now has a very calm and peaceful air about it.
4265^What can we expect from this arena?
4266^Tell us about the battles in Pirgos.
4267^
4268^Has Cresus seen many battles?
4269^Has Cresus seen many battles...
4270^(sigh)  I suppose one could say that, yes, Cresus has seen a lot of combat.  (sigh)
4271^Did you fight in the games?
4272^Did I choose to fight in the games?
4273^No.  Cresus did not choose to fight in the games.
4274^But many battles have been witnessed with these eyes.      Many battles...
4275^Have you seen any battles first hand?

4292^Why?\r\n\r\nBecause Pirgos is ...  my home...
4293^Is your family here with you?
4294^The only family Cresus has is his father.
4295^And is he here in Pirgos too?
4296^Um...  Nevermind, sorry.
4297^Cresus' father was--
4298^--is a brave man.
4299^Why did you settle in Pirgos?
4300^What happened to your father?
4301^Save Cresus' father
4302^Years ago, Cresus' father, Acrisius, sold himself into the custody of Queen Ibliis to pay for his son’s passage back to Imperia after a difficult adventure through the Windward Steppes and into the Southern Expanse where the two were waylaid by bandits.  \r\n\r\nAll his life, Cresus has been studying the ways of the arcane--working his shop just to make ends meet--in hopes that someday he’ll be powerful enough to go down to the Southern Expanse and free his father.  He’s getting anxious, however, and might like to send a school of gladiators down to do the job for him.\r\n\r\nHead to Saraa Izel in the Southern Expanse and try to free Acrisius.
4303^(Sigh)
4304^Cresus' father...
4305^When Cresus was a boy, he and his father, Acrisius left Pirgos and traveled to the Windward Steppes.  They had hired a band of mercenaries from the League Office here in Pirgos to be their guides.
4306^After crossing the border into the Windward Steppes, the mercenaries double crossed Cresus' father and robbed the two of all their money, leaving them only with what they wore on their backs.
4307^For weeks, they survived...  Eating nothing but what they could scavenge from the Earth...
4308^Eventually, Cresus' father found the tracks of a wagon train and the two followed them to a nomad encampment somewhere deep in The Wastes.
4309^It was night and there was a gladiatorial event happening.  They stole food from one of the vendors while her back was turned, but were caught in the act.
4310^They were then taken to Altahrun where they were made to compete in the historical leagues reenacting battles where citizens were made to suffer.
4311^Many people died in those battles...
4312^The arena's healers...
4313^They helped the gladiators, but they let the townsfolk die.
4314^Cresus and his father were very lucky to survive the battles.
4315^For what seemed like years, they stayed in Altahrun, prisoners of the League Officer.  We tried to fight well for him, because then we were treated better and kept well fed.
4316^But when we fought poorly, we were beaten and tortured.
4317^Finally, we escaped and crossed the Habaas River into the Southern Expanse.  Home was so far away, but my father carried on with godlike endurance.
4318^On our final breaths, dying under the scorching sun of the Qaa Rah Desert, we were discovered by the Royal Family of Ibliis and thought our salvation was nigh.
4319^But the tyrannical Queen Ibliis had other plans for us.  We were to become sacrifices in an arena somewhere deep in the Expanse.  But my father, thinking quickly, offered himself to her as her royal slave as long as she would see to it that I was returned to Imperia.
4320^He convinced her by allowing her to use him in her battles, much like we had been used in the battles in Altahrun.  He also swore allegience to her and the Expanse, denouncing his Imperial heritage.
4321^The Queen was so amused by his desperation that she accepted his conditions and lived up to her end of the bargain.
4322^I was returned to Imperia, albeit unfed and ill-kept.
4323^Some kind souls in Trikata helped get me on my feet and paid for my passage back to Pirgos.
4324^I then vowed to return to the Southern Expanse and rescue my father.  I started studying the ways of the Channelers, but I am not strong enough in the Arcane.  And I fear that I never wil be.
4325^But you...  You and your school...  I've seen you fight in the Pirgos Open Arena.  If you would travel to the Southern Expanse and free my father, Acrisius I would do anything within my power to help you in whatever you desire.
4326^Please help me, Cresus to get my father back...
4327^Cresus, we will help you.
4328^We will head to the Southern Expanse and find Acrisius.  By my own father, we will help you to find yours.
4329^We cannot.
4330^Your peril is tragic, Cresus, and we wish for you to find your father, but we just aren't strong enough to take the Queen Ibliis and her liege on.  I'm sorry, Cresus.  Our paths follow a different course.
4331^I--
4332^Cresus...  Understands.
4333^He will continue to train in the ways of the Arcane and pray to the Gods that his father will persevere until he can be saved.
4334^Thank you, gladiators, for hearing the story of Cresus and Acrisius.  Is there anything else Cresus can help you with today?
4335^GLADIATORS!  You have returned.
4336^Father, you have some visitors, I think.
4337^What is it Artemi--
4338^By the Gods...
4339^And here we meet again, gladiators--under much happier circumstances, if I may be so bold.
4340^Tell me, gladiators, what did my son have to offer you to come to my much needed rescue?
4341^Oh yes, The Oasis has always been a popular establishment for the Royal Family in Akar An.  Why, even the Queen herself came to my store once!
4342^This used to be one of the great cities governed by the iron-hand of Singh Iis Than.  Due to the tolls of time and the disarray of leadership after his death, his kingdom has fallen to the wayside and is reflected by a large population of transients that populate the cities.  Due to the largely migrant population, the city populations are broad and diverse.
4343^but I feel that it is my duty as one human to another to warn you against entering into anything you might not be ready for.
4344^History of Mordare
4345^Mördare is a town fraught with mystery and intrigue. For hundreds of years, it was a humble village that was slave to the whims of a giant forest dragon, who lived just outside the city walls. Mördare was founded as a small farming community, but eventually expanded and encroached on the dragon’s territory. Soon the city was living in fear of the terrible beast. The farming community died off and was replaced by dragon hunters, berserkers, and other thrill seekers. To this day, the locals fight among the dried bones of the dragon’s carcass in the very den where it met its untimely demise.

4858^Mördare's Den is the lair of an ancient dragon, and the arena itself is formed of its bones.
4859^While Orin's Keep is the most modern arena in Nordagh, its proximity to the seat of government prevents it from seeing too much use.

4861^Despite its isolation in the middle of the Sloan Forest, Stadium Dreas still manages to draw large crowds.
4862^The Fjord of the Fallen is the most remote arena in Nordagh.  The cold and snow is almost as much of an opponent as the local gladiators who thrive in it.
4863^Although Fliuch is Nordagh's largest city, arena combat is somewhat marginalized there, relegated to a private, marshy lot on the outskirts of town.
4864^This league is a free for all!  In a fight with only one winner, all alliances are temporary.

4891^Due to its precarious and out of the way location overlooking the gorge, this office has attracted mostly rogues and nomads.  The mix of combatants is diverse due to the transient population.  This is an office where combatants focus on developing their affinity skills.  All players are required to practice at least one affinity form.  Due to its mythic nature, historical leagues extolling the history of the land have been formed.

4937^Circus fighters to the end, they're known for having extreme range and accuracy with their Archers.  They will, from time to time recruit Peltasts and others, but definitely prefer the style of the Steppes' Archer.
4938^Pirgos, to outsiders, seems like a small agricultural trade town set in its old fashioned ways. For the most part, this holds true as settlers from Caltha chose to move here for a quieter existence. But once you delve into Pirgos and what it has to offer, you find that those who founded it had a strong sense of the arts and all the finer things in life, gladiatorial combat being no exception. The Pirgos Open Arena is more about showing off your skills than about bloodshed. This is the mindset of the majority of citizens who choose to make Pirgos their home. The city has a very calm and peaceful air about it.
4939^After successfully leading the Pirgos (then known as Bartonus) revolution of 1124, the great revolutionary Lameticus stood in the center of the newly liberated town and with great authority declared it free from the tyrannical rule of the local despot.  Planting his standard before him, legend says that the very earth shook.  The intensity of these few silent moments of glory was immediately castrated when a delusional counter-revolutionary placed a gladius through the spine of the great leader.  In his last effort the dying Lameticus swung about, drew his sword and slew the hapless deviant in one fell swoop.  The revolution without a leader, and the landlord without an army, life in Pirgos soon began to return to normal; however, a monument was erected on the spot where Lameticus fell, and the square eventually became known as a place to settle disputes...  For some reason most of these 'disputes' tended to result in bloodshed... most likely due to the violent history of the square.  The more fights and arguments, the more people stopped to watch;  many soon found it rather entertaining to watch strangers go at each other's throats.  A bunch of fights and a few forward-thinking entrepreneurs later and walls began to erect around the square with small admission fees covering the cost of construction.  Centuries later the Pirgos Open Arena is a major venue for not just the settlement of arguments, but for entire Gladiatorial leagues and championships.  The fair coastal weather, and downtown setting has made the arena a staple of family entertainment in the greater Pirgos area.

5348^History's greatest lessons teach us not to repeat the mistakes of the past…  Whatever nameless promoter founded the leagues at Theatre Antiquitus obviously overlooked this detail.  \r\n\r\nFor countless centuries this minimalist amphitheatre was a gathering place for philosophers, politicians, thinkers and peacemakers.  Making use of the open atmosphere, countless thoughts, ideas, problems and solutions had been presented here, and greeted with warm reception.  Many a war had come to its conclusion here, embraced by the gentle curve of this picturesque theatre...  \r\n\r\nTimes change; though just as many people gather here now, if not more, thinkers and philosophers they are not.  Though one could argue the validity of a philosophy of violence, warriors are now tested nightly in what is considered high-class blood sport.  Set into the famous Syrna hills, the stage is framed by a picturesque vista of the port town and ocean below.  When watching a match, a mere glance reveals the entire Syrna basin in all its glory.

5354^Tell us about the Arena in Akar An.
5355^Palace Ibliis
5356^Years ago, the tyrant King Rufiit loved arena combat and decided to have a courtyard from within his very own palace converted for the sport. Having access to regular matches at a whim would momentarily quench the ruler's thirst for the bloodshed. Seeing this, his ministers expanded the operation, hoping that the brutality in the arena would diminish Rufiit's own violence against the populace. \r\n\r\nThis continued until finally an entire wing of the palace was devoted to the daily matches. Now, long after Rufiit's death, the palace has been handed to Ibliis, a puppet leader placed in Akar An by the Imperials. The Palace of Ibliis is known as the premier arena in the Southern Expanse. With it's beautiful setting, history, and unique clientele, many a hero has been made here. With marble walls and walkways and elaborate ceramic mosaic work, this arena is a sight to behold.
5357^I'd like to hear about this town.
5358^Tell us about the city of Akar An.
5359^History of Akar An
5360^Akar An is a bustling river city situated near the bordering Windward Steppes and therefore does some trading with the nomads of the East. Akar An's anger with Imperia runs deep as the royal families of the city were imprisoned or killed during the war with the North. It not only almost ended Akar An's royal lineage, but changed the entire city forever. Now, Akar An's royal palace is used to train warriors in the graceful ways of the Dervish. Those who graduate from the Palace Academy are viewed as elite warriors, the closest thing to royalty that still exists in Akar An.
5361^History of Belfort
5362^After the Great War, the Imperials built the wall at Belfort to separate their land from Nordagh. The city remained a military camp during the early years of the post-war peace. Now the retired high-ranking members of the military are the upper-class residents of the town. There is a distinct class separation between the families of the so-called war heroes and rest of the residents of Belfort.
5363^Can you tell us about the Coliseum?
5364^Please tell us all about the Arena.
5365^The Arena at Caltha
5366^In my opinion, the Arena at Caltha is the pinnacle of gladiatorial glory, perhaps only surpassed by ascension to the kingdom of heaven.\r\nThe Arena was originally commissioned by the former head of the Senate, Acastus, a great visionary.  Planning alone took 15 designers nearly a decade to complete.  Final construction of this feat of engineering wasn’t even completed until some 20 years after Acastus’ death.  Only 3 of the original designers were still alive to witness the unveiling of their epic masterwork.  Nearly 2000 slaves died in its making.  400 beasts and several small villages also perished in the wake of its construction.  At the time, building resources were so scarce in Imperia that some say the massive campaigns against Nordagh were initially motivated out of the need for more stone and wood, simply to complete the Arena.  \r\nEven with so much blood already staining the Coliseum, the populace was more than ready to support the blood-sport within and the Arena at Caltha has become the jewel in the crown of the Imperial Empire.  With seating for over 30,000 spectators, pilgrims come from far and wide to fill this cathedral of violence, flavored with statues, columns and pennants.  \r\nIt is truly a sight to behold.  However, it’s not easy getting into the High Tournaments.  Only the best gladiators in the land are even considered.  And success in the Arena at Caltha amounts to far more than mere prize money...  The cheering crowd can be a powerful inspiration and many gladiators have ridden its wave to victory.
5367^What can you tell us about Caltha?
5368^Tell us a bit about Caltha.
5369^History of Caltha
5370^Caltha, the capital city of Imperia, is located inland and is central to all the other cities in the region. The Hatteus River flows through the center of the city not far from the Arena at Caltha, which allows the export of Caltha’s biggest crop, olives. \r\n\r\nThe Senate of Caltha was founded by the wealthiest farmers of the area hundreds of years ago. At first they were just interested in increasing their personal fortunes by trading with other lands, but eventually became ambassadors and leaders for the people of Imperia. As the population grew and other Senates formed in other towns, the Caltha Senate became the leaders of the land. For many years the land of Imperia has prospered under the rule of the Caltha Senate.
5371^I want to hear about Mongrel's Maw.
5372^The Mongrel's Maw
5373^The Mongrel’s Maw is located on the other side of Cro Beska from here.  It is also on the outskirts of town, but is positioned so that you have to go through town to get to it.  I think it’s a sort of intimidation game the Mongrels like to play with their potential victims.\r\n\r\nThe Mongrel’s Maw was built by the Mongrels, also its primary audience.  It was built to mimic what the Mongrels glimpsed of the civilized world, but any fame that the Maw has gotten is purely for reasons disrespectful.  It was launched into infamy on the day that 100 slaves were decimated by an Ogre before the Ogre finally got bored and fell asleep in the middle of the arena.  The remaining slaves were given to families of Mongrels to do their choosing with.\r\n\r\nAfter this event, the arena was doomed to carry with it an unwholesome reputation.  If you’re seeking a challenge, the Maw is the place for you to go, but I feel that it is my duty as one human to another to warn you against entering into anything you might not be ready for.  Those Mongrels fight very dirty.
5374^What can you tell us about this town?
5375^Tell us about Cro Beska.
5376^History of Cro Beska
5377^The city of Cro Beska is home to the Mongrels. They are monstrous men who toiled in the mines of Imperia for years as slaves until they were granted their freedom after a bloody revolt. Now the Mongrels run the town by force, trading with a few brave locals who dare to enter the city.\r\n\r\nThe arena is the only place in Cro Beska that is safe for normal humans to travel regularly. Those who enter the rest of the town run the risk of becoming prisoners to the Mongrels. Those currently holed up in Cro Beska are often forced to fight in the games or sometimes they are awarded as prizes.
5378^What's the history of The Fen?
5379^Tell us about your arena.
5380^The Fen
5381^The arena in Fliuch is appropriately named The Fen.  It is little more than a gloomy, smelly, and dank mud pit that could just as well be used as a pigpen than an arena. There are weathered wooden planks around the arena that define its shape, which changes from year to year. The planks are there less to prevent the fighters from escaping than to keep the crowd from joining in.  \r\n\r\nThe mud in the arena is always wet with blood and rain and there are sometimes rocks and bones sticking up from the packed earth below the layer of dredge. It is a minimalist arena that delivers the simple pleasures of the arena that those in Nordagh desire.
5382^Tell us about Fliuch.
5383^Tell us a bit about this city, Fliuch.
5384^History of Fliuch
5385^Fliuch is Nordagh’s most prosperous city, but the citizens are a bit rough around the edges. A long time ago, Fliuch was established as a trade town but as more and more people moved into the city, fewer and fewer outsiders breached its walls, carrying out their business just outside of the borders.  Fliuch is now a marsh town, surrounded by bogs and lakes.  Bridges and walkways span some of the dense moors in order to keep the trade routes open.  \r\n\r\nNordagh has reputation among the other regions for being a wild place.  But to the natives, Fliuch is a wonderful place to live and visit.  It has the best taverns, entertainment, and shops.  Being a trade town, Fliuch often has items that aren’t usually found in this region. Muscle does rule this town, however, so outsiders should be especially careful.
5386^Tell us the story of Mördare's Den.
5387^Can you tell us anything about your arena?
5388^Mördare's Den
5389^This arena is situated inside the den of the long deceased dragon. It is a cold, dark, and damp place for combat, with deep unexplored recesses hidden in the shadows beyond the light of the torches that ring the arena. In the center rests an imposing sight, the remains of the dragon, including the giant skull imbedded in the side of the arena. Stretching underneath the arena floor, the corpse of the mighty beast is exposed from a giant femur to the ribcage cascading from the packed earth. Spectators stand on the edge of this sunken grave to throw insults, and whatever else they can find, down upon the combatants.
5390^Tell us about Mördare and its history.
5391^Can you share some local history?
5392^Your arena is unique.  Tell us about it.
5393^Tell us about the arena in this town.
5394^The Public Arena of Ononhaar
5395^The people of Ononhaar needed a place to spar, as life in the Windward Steppes is often fraught with danger. The Public Arena is used not only to hone skills of defense against man, but also against beast. The arena here became popular with the peoples of the Windward Steppes and eventually they started charging people to come and watch the competitions there. The arena is basically a large circle in the dirt.  Honor keeps the matches from getting out of hand, since there are no walls to contain the battle.
5396^Ononhaar looks nice.  Tell us about it.
5397^What can you tell us about Ononhaar?
5398^History of Ononhaar
5399^Ononhaar is the smaller of the two biggest settlements in the Windward Steppes, and because of its intact heritage, it is the more respected of the two.  People settled in Ononhaar because of the plentiful hunting, which means there is always plenty of food in Onohaar.  The citizens of Ononhaar live a peaceful, meditative life, between hunting for food on the Great Plains and trading with other settlements in the Windward Steppes. Over the past few decades, however, the food supply has been waning and the people of Ononhaar may move to another area of the Great Plains. The citizens of Ononhaar are a more cerebral people and tend to be more impressed with technique and the art of combat than they are with unskilled bloodshed.
5400^Tell us about the arena here.
5401^Exuro's Eye, right?  Tell us about it.
5402^Exuro’s Eye is possibly the most dangerous arena in Imperia because it is nestled inside the cone of the volcano Aduro.  Aduro hasn’t erupted in about 150 years, but the well-to-do locals wait with baited breath for the next disastrous outpouring of lava.<p><p>Throughout the battlefield are fissures and pools of lava, which can spew fire and lava onto the gladiators.  It’s not uncommon for the audience to sometimes be hit. That’s why admission to The Eye is typically less than that of other arenas in the region.
5403^Exuro's Eye
5404^Tell us about this beautiful town.
5405^What can you tell us about Orus?
5406^History of Orus
5407^There are two reasons why Orus has such a strong populace. The first is The Eye, a gladiator arena that frames warriors in fire and brimstone.  Another draw to Orus are the hot springs at the base of volcano Aduro.  There are also many spas in Orus, where victorious warriors receive pampering after a hard battle. \r\n\r\nOrus became popular among the high class of Imperia and the rich foreigners who travel the region.  The city center is very beautiful.  Also, the citizens of Orus have a great adoration for Exuro, the Fire Affinity God and patron of the arena who keeps the flames of the Eye forever lit.
5408^What's the arena like here?
5409^The Pit
5410^There isn’t much to tell about the local arena, The Pit.  They dug in the ground like the Imperials did, but unlike Belfort, they didn’t find anything in Roanor. But they started the games there anyway.  Now many people come here to take part in the gladiator games and to watch them.  Sometimes they even put animals in the games. Like other arenas, it costs money to fight in The Pit, and to go to watch the games as well.  But the warriors who fight can make a lot of money.  And that’s how this shop stays in business.
5411^Tell us about Roanor.
5412^Talk to us about the city.
5413^History of Roanor
5414^Roanor is a strong city on the other side of the wall from Belfort in Imperia.  There are few trees in Roanor unlike the rest of Nordagh. The city was started when people wanted to travel to Imperia but had to wait at the wall.  So they finally stopped waiting and founded a city.  Smuggling goods from Imperia is the most profitable way to make a living in Roanor. There’s also the Nordagh Watchmen, who are like the army in this time of peace. They man the gates, regulating travel between the two lands.
5415^What's the arena like in Saraa Izel?
5416^Can you tell us about your arena?
5417^The Offering Plate
5418^The Offering Plate is a sacrificial altar where offerings are made to all six of the Affinity Gods. As news of the gladiator games came from the Royal Palace, The Offering Plate started doubling as an arena where the Arcane could challenge one another in duels. The next step was obviously to start hosting daring battles for those willing to brave the Mists of Izel. Fashioned from flawless marble, this circular arena is a perfect shape to use mgical energy. The Offering Plate is as mysterious to those who live within near it as the Mists of Izel are to wide-eyed travelers.
5419^What's Saraa Izel like?
5420^Tell us about your city.
5421^History of Saraa Izel
5422^No one knows exactly how old the ancient city of Saraa Izel is. Most of the people who live in Saraa Izel are Summoners or Channelers or those training in the ways of the arcane. People in Saraa Izel have been known to fall ill by living so close to such raw magical power, while others find it therapeutic. A permanent fog looms over the Saraa Izel, which adds to city’s mysterious reputation. It’s said that the power of the Affinity Gods is what keeps the fog from evaporating.  For under the fog are many of the Gods’ servants. Rumors of powerful magic and the fog cause most travelers to give this entire area a wide berth when traveling through the Southern Expanse.
5423^What's the arena like in the Sloan Forest?
5424^Is there an arena in the Sloan Forest?
5425^Stadium Dreas
5426^Stadium Dreas is located just inside the Sloan Forest in the cavity left behind when the famous Tavoaich tree fell during the Storm of the Ages. The Tavoaich tree was the tallest tree in the Sloan Forest and marked the border to the unexplored region of the immense wooded area. Once the tree had fallen, tales of great destructive powers from deep within the forest made their way into Nordagh lore and people started to explore the region, searching for this power. As people began to inhabit the forest, the remains of the tree were used for building houses and temples, in hopes that the strength within the wood would ward off evil spirits. Two seeds were taken from the tree and planted in the recess made by its collapse. Until those trees envelope the hole, gladiatorial combat will take place in the cavity of the mighty Tavoaich tree, between the two century-old saplings.
5427^What can you tell us about the Sloan Forest?
5428^Tell us about the forest.
5429^History of The Sloan Forest
5430^The Sloan Forest is the first image to come to mind when speaking of Nordagh. Shrouding more than a third of the region with a dense covering of trees, the Sloan Forest is home to the Galdr witches, and therefore, much intrigue. There are hundreds of settlements throughout the forest, including the King's hunting residence, but nothing big enough to be considered a proper city. The forest has small rivers and creeks flowing throughout, with watermills and canals supplying homes with constant fresh water. Just inside the forest lies Stadium Dreas, a favorite arena in Nordagh.
5431^How was the city of Syrna founded?
5432^What can you tell us about Syrna?
5433^History of Syrna
5434^Syrna is located on the western shore of Imperia between Trikata and the border with Nordagh. It is an upscale village and the summer home to many of Imperia's Senators and other wealthy families. It is a beautiful place to visit with good weather to give visitors from the bigger cities a glorious taste of small town life.
5435^Tell us about the Arena in Syrna.
5436^I want to know about the arena.
5437^Theatre Antiquitis
5438^For years the minimalist amphitheatre was a gathering place for philosophers, politicians, and peacemakers. Making use of the open atmosphere, countless thoughts, ideas, problems, and solutions had been presented here, and greeted with warm receptions. \r\n\r\nTimes change and now just as many people gather here, but they are no longer thinkers and philosophers. Warriors battle nightly in the Theatre in what is considered by some residents as a high-class blood sport. Set into the famous Syrna hills, the stage is framed by a striking vista of the port town and ocean below.
5439^What can you tell us about this town?
5440^Tell my school about Trikata.
5441^History of Trikata
5442^Unlike its wealthy sister city Caltha, the coastal town of Trikata is strictly a working class metropolis. It's arena, the Bloody Halo, is a reflection of the city's attitude of straightforward common sense, which is in direct contrast to the opulent Arena at Caltha. The games bring tourists not only from the rest of Imperia, but also from other lands, as Trikata is Imperia's main harbor on the coast of the Aeonis Sea. Now a booming metropolis, Trikata was founded as a trade town, but soon outgrew its humble beginnings. Those who didn't fancy the big city life moved up the coast and founded the city of Syrna.
5443^Why is your arena called The Bloody Halo?
5444^Tell us about The Bloody Halo.
5445^The Bloody Halo
5446^Nestled in the center of the bustling business district of Trikata is a simple arena known for its intense battles instead of the spectacle of its architecture. Originally named after its benefactor, Maximo Abavus, one of the most prominent merchants in the early days of Trikata who was also a prison warden. In the early days of the arena prisoners from the Expanse were made to fight here. Things have changed since then and Abavus' only remaining legacy is the betting window that he opened to attempt to make back the money he spent constructing the arena.\r\n\r\nNow this arena is known only by its nickname, the Bloody Halo. The arena got this name because the slight hill in the middle of the battlefield causes the blood to flow to the edges of the arena. When the sun hits it in the morning mist, the arena glows like a bloody halo.
5447^Tell us about this city.
5448^What's Yuset like?
5449^History of Yuset
5450^The biggest city in the Steppes, Yuset has been partially stripped of its heritage after its occupation by the Imperial army. One remnant of its past is the giant archway at the city's end, where a constant nomad presence resides. As one group of nomads moves on, another moves in and the cycle continues in the hope that their ancient culture will not be totally forgotten. Other than being a nomad stronghold, Yuset is surrounded on both sides by the Baitan mountain range with rolling hills and cliffs alike. Yuset is not a very hospitable place for visitors from other lands, as the constant flow of nomads through the town gives the locals all they need to survive.
5451^What's the local arena like?
5452^Tell us about the arena here.
5453^Arena Suren
5454^Arena Suren is built in the shadow of one of the signature towering rock structures found throughout the Windward Steppes. Long ago, a beast-master named Suren kept his pride of hideous monsters in these caves. After he died, a group of traveling nomads found the gated entrances to the caves and decided to explore the depths within. The beasts made quick work of the wanderers. Days later, another group of nomads found one of the survivors, staggering through the Wastes in a state of shock. \r\n\r\nAfter many years the tall tales of the beasts contained within the caves had been elevated to such heights that nobody dared to enter the caverns. It wasn't until a group of warriors from Imperia came to prove themselves as heroes, that a group was finally organized to explore the caves. All they found were the remains of the victims of the now legendary monsters. Unable to prove their might by slaying the legendary beasts, the warriors decided to fence the area off and hold gladiatorial fights upon the plain at the foot of the rock wall. The games have been a tradition in Yuset ever since.
5455^Due to its mobility, this league attracts a diverse range of misfits and renegades from the region.  Battles draw from a broad range of schools and monetary rewards are high.  Without a home to call their own, the Amazons have adopted the Wandering Soul as their base of operations.
5456^This exclusive league is run by Amazon members of the Riot Ghyrls.  They forbid any males from competing in their league sanctioned battles.  Complete this league and earn their respect.  After doing so, you will be able to recruit Amazons into your school.
5457^Tell us about your local arena.
5458^What's your local arena like?
5459^Altahrun Ruins
5460^The arena is situated inside the ruins in the Ultasan Gorge. No one knows who built the ruins either.  They’re falling apart and fairly dangerous. It is rumored that the people who built them were killed in an earthquake. People sit in the caves on the cliff face to watch the games. There are also reenactment battles that happen here.
5461^How was Altahrun founded?
5462^What's the history of Altahrun?
5463^History of Altahrun
5464^Altahrun is a small village, like most in the Windward Steppes. There aren’t really any permanent buildings. There was a great earthquake, which revealed the ruins on the cliffs below the village. The ruins are located in the Ultasan Gorge and they are used as the arena, which is called the Altahrun Ruins.
5465^What is The Wastes like?
5466^Tell us about The Wastes.
5467^History of The Wastes
5468^The Wastes of the Windward Steppes is a land of mystery and intrigue. Nomads of the Wandering Soul have traversed The Wastes for hundreds of years.  Even when rulers from other lands try to lay claim over our lands, the people here remained Nomads. Those who have settled in places like Yuset and Ononhaar are believed to have grown weaker because they’ve compromised the Nomad existence. Hunters and crafters make up most of our population of the Wastes, although there are also many strong warriors.
5469^What is your arena like?
5470^Can you tell us about your arena?
5471^Pitch of the Wandering Soul
5472^The Pitch of the Wandering Soul is probably is the hardest arena to find in all the known lands. Since the Nomads are always on the move, the Pitch of the Wandering Soul rarely ends up in the same place twice. In the center of the camp, there is a large section of land surrounded by carts and some fences. Usually when there’s a fight going on, merchants open their shops at a discount and the prizes awarded in The Pitch are generous. Entry fees for battles can be expensive for outsiders. There are many series and endurance battles here. They are a particular favorite of the crowd.
5473^Lioness

6074^The crowd is impressed!
6075^Cro Beska is the only known city in all of Imperia inhabited solely by the Mongrels. Once it was discovered, Imperials stopped exploring the surrounding region due to the violent nature of the Mongrels. The Imperials set up a rudimentary trade system with the creatures, ultimately taking advantage of them. Seeing the way the Imperials lived, the Mongrels were inspired to build an arena of their own, modeling it after the popular sport of the civilized world. The trade relationship continued to allow access by outsiders to fight in their arena with safe ingress and egress to and from the city. However, the only humans that stay in Cro Beska are prisoners of the Mongrels. Viewed as a commodity, these prisoners are often forced to fight in the games and/or are awarded as prizes.

6165^Tainted Claws
6166^Orus sits at the base of a semi-active volcano high in the Cardis Mountains. Made famous by its spas and natural hot springs, Orus has become a favorite vacation spot for the upper crust of Imperia and rich foreigners alike. The actual city of Orus is very ornate and majestic looking. The citizens are pleasant for the most part, which is why their arena Exuro’s Eye draws so much attention—it is the one thing in Orus that seems less refined. Atop the mountain sits Orus’ arena, in the gaping mouth of the volcano Aduro.
6167^Exuro's Eye is probably the most dangerous arena in Imperia… and not just for the contestants.  The battlefield itself is actually nestled inside the cone of a semi-dormant volcano.  While the volcano has not actually erupted in nearly 150 years, it is by no means inactive.  Several perilous cracks and small pools of lava adorn the surface of this sleeping giant, occasionally releasing scorching gouts of highly destructive lava onto the combatants and spectators alike.  Admission to this arena is generally less than that of other venues, but for good reason, things don't always go as planned here.  Trespassing in the land of Exuro is not for the faint of heart.  The terrain is generally composed of sometimes jagged, sometimes smooth lava flow of centuries past.  Lightly dusted with a thin layer of ash, this harsh gray landscape is highlighted by the deep orange glow emanating from the various fissures, pools and fractures scattered about.  Spectators stand about 5 meters above; ringing the arena along the rim of the dormant cone...  small barriers have been erected here to prevent accidental falls into the arena.

6366^I come here a lot since my husband died...
6367^My husband was a good man, I miss him terribly.
6368^My husband and I used to go to Syrna during the summer, it's right on the coast you know.  I'd shop in the markets and he would watch the games.
6369^These beaches weren't always so peaceful.  Years ago this is where Imperia launched its attack on the Southern Expanse.  The shore was lined with ships as far as the eye could see.  I was only a little girl then, but I still remember.  Yes I do.
6370^Sometimes you can find items washed up on the shore in the early morning.  The currents carry them from all over.  My husband and I used to collect them...  he loved the sea.
6371^I just want to be alone if you don't mind.  Alone with my thoughts.
6372^Good Morning!  Good Morning!
6373^Early in the day, that's when I like to travel.  The air is fresh, no dust kicked up on the roads.
6374^I used to make my deliveries in the evening, but not anymore!.  No no.  Dangerous dealings on the roads if you stay out too late.
6375^I carry my goods to Pirgos.  If you are looking for equipment make sure to look in the shops.  But don't buy just anywhere, shop around for the best deals!
6376^It's good to see young people up so early!  My children are so lazy they are going to sleep their lives away.
6377^I've got to hurry to Pirgos!  No time to chat, the buyers won't wait for long.
6378^Serve justice and Imperia by punishing these miscreants.

6405^The arena of Cro Beska, the Mongrel’s Maw is located on the outskirts of town, across from the Shop. The Mongrels built the arena to mimic what little they'd glimpsed of the civilized world.  \r\n\r\nAfter an event where a single Ogre killed 100 slaves, the arena was doomed to carry with it an unwholesome reputation forever.  The Maw is a severely challenging place for a human gladiator to compete.  The Mongrels do not follow the same rules of conduct that the gladiator games in the rest of Imperia do.
6406^The Arena at Caltha is by far the most spectacular arena in all the lands. The Imperial Championships, known as the High Tournaments, are held here. The great visionary Acastus originally commissioned the arena. The planning and design alone took 15 designers nearly 10 years to complete. The Arena wasn’t completed until 20 years after Acastus’ death. \r\n\r\nWith seating for over 30,000 spectators, people came from all lands to witness the spectacle inside. Fighting in Caltha is a daunting task, and entry does not come easily. Only the best gladiators in the land are even considered and, of those, even fewer succeed in the games at the Arena at Caltha.

7019^Training to fight
7020^It’s official! I’m in the gladiator school! Father let me compete! Today we began training. Usus, father’s friend from Imperia, sure knows a lot about the gladiator games. He’s a little weird, though, I don’t know, rough around the edges, I guess. But I’ve never met anyone from Imperia before, so I guess he’s just different. He’s such a good friend of father’s that I’m sure I’ll get to understand him better as the training continues. I can’t wait to start competing in the games.
7021^Let the games begin
7022^Our first games were a success! It feels so great to be outside the castle walls. I almost don’t care if we win or lose, just as long as we get to travel around Nordagh and see new places. Although Urlan might throw me off the team if I don’t do well, so I better try extra hard. I’ll just have to use my special powers to be sure that we win.
7023^Strange encounter
7024^A weird thing happened today. We came a cross one of those Galdr witches as we traveled to the next tournament. I’ve heard father and Urlan talk of them before, but they always stop when they realize I’m listening. The witches sure are creepy. I wonder what that one was talking about? The witch said she’d be watching me. Why? What do those creatures want from me?
7025^Mystery in Roanor
7026^Usus seemed a little disturbed by being in Roanor. I wonder why? And when he heard about the robbery of the Temple, he was as upset as I’ve ever seen him. I know Roanor was the site of the end of the Great War. He must have taken part in that battle. I wonder what really happened then? The stories I’ve heard are all so horrific. I’d like to ask Usus about it, but I don’t want to upset him. Maybe I will after I get to know him better.
7027^Dreams of the past
7028^I had the strangest dream last night. I don’t really know what it was about, but it left me with the most bizarre feeling in the morning. I could have sworn I saw mother in the dream. I really miss her. I wish she lived long enough to see Urlan and me grow up. I think she’d be really proud of us. Father’s never been the same since she’s been gone. I bet he’s lonely in that big castle without Urlan and me.
7029^Return to the childhood home
7030^It’s great to be back in the Sloan Forest. Some of my favorite childhood memories took place here, before we moved to that big, boring castle. Urlan was much more fun here. He got too serious once he joined the royal court. Maybe he’ll loosen up as we continue on in the games. We’re doing pretty well, I think. Although you could never tell by the way Urlan talks. He’s always complaining about something. I just wish the Galdr weren’t here. Why do they have to ruin our homecoming? They’re just weird. I wished they’d just leave us alone.
7031^Monstrous Mordare
7032^This is one of the most amazing places I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe we actually fought in the belly of dragon! To think there was a time when those things roamed the forests of Nordagh. That’s frightening! Well, we’ve still got monsters in Nordagh now, with the Galdr and those crazy Berserkers. I’ve heard stories of other things as well. But I really don’t want to run into any of them during our travels.
7033^Connection to the past
7034^This is my new favorite spot in all of Nordagh! It’s really beautiful and I just know that a Valkyrie spirit is still there. I think I saw her up in the hills. In fact, I know I did. I could feel it. I could also feel my special powers there, too. It’s just like those stories grandmother used to tell, about the powerful female warriors who were a beacon of light to the rest of land. I wish I could have met a Valkyrie before they all died. It sounded like they were quite amazing.
7035^A brave new world
7036^I can’t believe it; father is actually going to let me compete in the games in other lands! I’m finally going to see some place other than Nordagh. How amazing! I can’t wait to see Imperia, although I wonder what he and Urlan talked about? What was so important that I couldn’t here about it? He didn’t even tell Usus. That’s strange. Oh well, I’ll worry about that later. I’ve got to get ready for our travels in Imperia.
7037^Lukewarm welcome in Imperia
7038^Our first stop in Imperia wasn’t very exciting. It’s not that much different than Roanor. I guess that’s because it’s just on the other side of the wall. But I long to see big buildings, rolling hills of grass, and the ocean. That’s what I really want to see, the ocean. A warm, breezy, sandy coast, now that’s my idea of perfection.
7039^Unwanted encounter in Belfort
7040^The other people we’ve met in Imperia are sure different Usus. That old acquaintance of his that we ran into, Mutuus I think his name was, sure was angry. It seemed like he was trying to get us to leave Imperia by being really rude, but that’s not going to work. He doesn’t scare me. I’d love to see him put in his place.
7041^The wonders of Imperia
7042^What a beautiful place! This is what I thought Imperia would be like, scenic and wonderful. I could really get used to this, although I would eventually miss the forests of Nordagh, and my father, and probably even that big brother of mine. Oh well, at least I get to visit these places. I never would have imagined that just a few months ago.
7043^A most welcome discovery
7044^I think I met the most interesting person in all of Imperia today. His name is Valens. He was charming and smart, but he seemed a little sad. He said it was because his school wasn’t doing well in the games, but I bet it’s more than that. I’ve never met anyone like him before. I wonder if I’ll ever see him again. Hopefully we’ll travel to another stadium where his team is competing. Oh, if the God’s could grant me that one wish I’d be forever grateful. And the next time I see him I won’t say such embarrassing things.
7045^Valens saves the day
7046^It seems the Gods do answer prayers. I thought they were punishing me for bothering them with my petty request because those sorcerers attacked us. But it was just all part of their master plan, as Valens came to our aid. He’s so strong. I bet he’s even stronger than Urlan, or at least a better warrior. His home is amazing, but I can see why he’s so sad. He’s left in that big place all alone. That’s just how I felt in father’s castle. But now that he’s coming with us, I’m sure he’ll feel better. He seems like he would be a happy person. I wonder what he thinks of me?
7047^The people of Imperia
7048^The people of Imperia sure are different. Some are incredibly rude and mean while others, like Valens, are very nice. Even Usus has lightened up a bit during our travels. He’s still gruff, but I am really glad that he’s with us. Valens might not have even joined our school if it wasn’t for Usus. Since my brother can never keep his big mouth shut, Valens almost didn’t. But he did, so I won’t hold that against Urlan. He just doesn’t know any better.
7049^The monsters of Imperia
7050^This is a very strange place. I can’t believe it’s in the middle of Imperia, a bunch of monsters right in the center of the Emperor’s land. It doesn’t seem like Imperials would stand for something like this, especially the rich and snobby ones. But I guess those people just pretend Cro Beska doesn’t exist. This town reminds me a little of Nordagh, though. They’re just a little rough around here, not unlike the Berserkers or even some of the less civilized Barbarians. It’s nothing that those of us from Nordagh can’t handle.
7051^Watching the Caltha games
7052^Caltha is amazing! I could see Usus and Valens light up once they got inside that massive arena. Of course Urlan wasn’t impressed, but nothing ever impresses him, at least, not outside of Nordagh. But I was impressed, was I ever. I really hope we can compete here one day. Valens would like that. Maybe Usus will help us get there. I just hope father allows me to compete if we make it there. I still worry that one of these days he going to show up and drag me back to the castle. He better not.
7053^Intriguing Pirgos
7054^Pirgos is an interesting place. And those Channelers, they were fascinating. They look like royalty, or goddesses. Their powers are quite impressive. I wonder how they got them? Did the Affinity God’s just grant them the powers one day? Or did they have them at birth? Did the God’s give me my powers as well? I don’t think I’ll ever figure that out. Valens sure seemed uncomfortable here, though. Some of the Channelers were really staring at him. I wonder why. I know he’s handsome and all that, but why would they look at him like that?
7055^An unwelcome reunion
7056^We ran into Mutuus again. He’s becoming a real pain. He makes Valens go silent. There was something weird between the two of them. I’ve never seen Valens act that way before. Urlan thought he was scared, but I know Valens much better than he does. He wasn’t scared. Maybe I should ask him about Mutuus. I probably shouldn’t. I don’t want to upset him.
7057^Dreaming again
7058^I had more dreams last night. They were the same as before, but I remember them more clearly this time. I saw visions that seem to come right from the stories grandma used to tell me when I was little. I guess they’re just buried in my memory. It seems like it has to be more than just that, but I don’t know. It’s like someone is trying to talk to me. But who and why? Maybe I’ll find out the next time I dream.
7059^What’s to like?
7060^This could have really been an amazing place, but all the people here are the Imperials that I don’t like. Rich, elitist, and rude, I’m surprised we didn’t see Mutuus here. It seems like his kind of place. Well, I guess I can’t like every town in Imperia. We can always go back to Syrna.
7061^New land, new warrior
7062^Now that we’re in the Windward Steppes, I was expecting things to be different, well worse, than Imperia. I haven’t heard good things about this land. But now that we’re here, I like it. I think I really enjoy seeing other lands. And we are meeting the most fascinating people on this trip. Today we met Eiji. She’s small, like a young girl, but she talks and acts like, well, I don’t know, unlike any girl I’ve ever met. She’s really clever. I don’t think Urlan likes her, which makes me like her even more. I wonder what Valens thinks of her?
7063^Girl power
7064^Eiji sure is impressive in battle. We’ve got a good school going now. I really think we will fight in Caltha. I enjoy the way Eiji talks to Urlan. I could learn a thing or two from her. Valens seems to like her, too, which is good. I just hope he doesn’t like her too much. He’s seems to be having a good time in the games. I know I am. This is all working out so well.
7065^Eiji joins our school permanently
7066^I’m glad Eiji is coming with us for the rest of our games. We could use more women like her in our school, and not just because she annoys Urlan so much. She is such a flirt though; I should keep an eye on her when she’s with Valens. I’m not jealous, I just want to...oh never mind, I’m just jealous.
7067^Warriors of the Wastes
7068^The Amazons are so amazing. I’d like to think that they’re a little like the Valkyrie, so strong and confident. They’re really beautiful, too. It’s amazing all the new and wonderful things I’ve seen since I left Nordagh. Father wouldn’t believe it. Although he’d probably be like Urlan; I don’t think that ridiculous brother of mine has even bothered to open his eyes and see what’s going on in these lands as we travel.
7069^Looking ahead
7070^Good old Eiji, she’s always making things tough on Urlan. Maybe she can get through to him and make him enjoy the other lands. I know she helps me enjoy the Steppes. Although, all the archers make the tournaments here tough, but it’s a good challenge for us. I imagine we’ll have to handle much worse at Caltha. But with both Valens and I on the battlefield, no one can defeat us!
7071^This old town
7072^What a truly creepy place. And those Imperial warriors we faced, they were very nasty. I think they got to Valens as well. I wonder what it is about them? Maybe it’s just the old spirits floating around this ancient place that makes everyone ill at ease. I know they give me the chills.
7073^The temptress
7074^And I thought Mutuus was the worst person we would encounter in the games. I was wrong. That sorceress was truly horrible. She was trying to tempt Urlan into joining her school and even Valens seemed a little intrigued by her. Why? She’s not that striking. She must have some sort of magical aura that only affects men. If I ever see her again, it will be too soon.
7075^Still dreaming of the past
7076^My dreams returned last night. They were clearer than ever before. I saw visions of Valkyrie and of my mother. But it was all so sad. I wonder why? All of grandmother’s stories were so happy. Why would my dreams be so sad? Is the person who is trying to communicate with me sad? Is it my mother? But why did it take her so long to contact me? I miss her so much. Maybe I’m wrong, and I just wish it was her.
7077^Dark force rising
7078^As we were leaving the Steppes we saw that sorceress again and all those strange Imperial soldiers. What were they doing? What is that evil witch up to? Some people in Nordagh were worried about a war; did they see things like this? Usus doesn’t seem very concerned about it. I guess he’d probably know best.
7079^Another new face
7080^We’ve met another interesting person on our trip. He’s a powerful warrior from the Southern Expanse. I bet he’s definitely stronger than Urlan. But he’s really quiet, like I wish Urlan would be. It’s sad he doesn’t have a home or a family. I wish we could help him. But it seems that his life debt will keep him traveling with us. That sure is strange. But I respect it. It’s good to have a code of honor. It would keep people out of wars forever if they all had a code to live by, one that wouldn’t allow people to harm each other.
7081^Blast from the past
7082^This land is really different from anything we’ve seen before. I like it. But I don’t know if Valens does. He seemed really upset by that old friend of his that we battled. He was sort of creepy. I didn’t think he was the kind of guy that Valens would be a friend with. He seemed shallow and cruel. Why would Valens be his friend if that guy always acted like that? Maybe he used to be different. But what would make him change so dramatically? Or maybe I don’t know Valens as well as I thought I did.
7083^Gwazi needs help
7084^Well it looks like we’ll be able to help Gwazi after all. I hope nothing happens to his village. I’d feel really bad. But he has been honorable, so we should return the favor. I know Valens understands that. I just hope Urlan goes along with it. I’m glad Gwazi was able to open up to us. I bet he’ll really help us in Caltha.
7085^Bothered by Eiji
7086^I’ve been noticing Eiji looking at Valens a lot lately. But I thought that I was just being overly jealous. Then she came to talk to me last night. She wanted to talk to me about Valens. She’s such a flirt. And she thought that if she just told me what she wanted to be with Valens it would be all right with me. Well, it isn’t. And I wasn’t going to stand there and listen to it. I feel very strongly about Valens. I don’t know exactly how he feels about me, but I want to give him a chance to figure it out. Not have him fooled into doing something by someone who’s just having fun. I guess I should probably talk to him about it. I just don’t know if I can.
7087^Walking into a trap
7088^I can’t believe that Gwazi was fooling us all that time. I guess I’m just not as good a judge of character as I thought I was. Something feels different now. I don’t know what it is. Like something inside me was unlocked. If that even makes sense. My powers seem to be constantly present now. And they react when Valens is around. Maybe that’s just my imagination. It could just be all those feelings I have for him. I should really talk to him.
7089^Heading to the Caltha games
7090^Usus says we’re ready for Caltha and I believe him. It’s time for this school to go to the High Tournaments. We did it. We accomplished our goal. But I don’t think Usus or Valens will be happy with just making it there. They’ll want to win in front of their Emperor. That would be cool, too. I want to win it just to make Valens happy.
7091^Usus says we’re ready for Caltha and I believe him. It’s time for this school to go to the High Tournaments. We did it. We accomplished our goal. But I don’t think Usus or Valens will be happy with just making it there. They’ll want to win in front of their Emperor. That would be fantastic, too. I want to win it just to make Valens happy.
7092^Tragedy everywhere
7093^Everything has changed. Father’s now dead. Why did he have to die? We lost mother too soon. Did he have to go too? It’s more than I can bear. And it’s not all. Urlan’s my twin. What does that mean? Why didn’t father tell us that? And why do the witches care about that? I want to know. But I don’t know if we have time to find out. Imperia’s army is closing in. War is coming. I cannot believe it. Urlan is now King of Nordagh. I don’t think he ever imagined that would happen so soon. And what of Valens? What is he going to do now? What if our homelands are at war? Will he leave?
7094^The time has come
7095^Well, Urlan has taken a stand. We’re going to see what those witches know. And Valens will be coming with us. I shouldn’t have ever doubted that. I knew he would stand by my side when I needed him. It comforts me to know that Valens is with me for this trip, but I am still afraid. I feel like I’m never coming home again. That makes me sad, but I must be brave.
7096^A brand new tomorrow
7097^Today is the start of a new life. I now lead my father’s school. I cannot guarantee that we will be Imperial Champions, but I do know that I will not let my father’s impact on the games be forgotten. I dedicate myself to returning this school to its rightful place. And Ludo is just as committed as I am.
7098^Friend from the past
7099^What a terrific surprise! My father’s dear friend Usus has returned to help us rebuild the school. The Affinity Gods are truly with us now. Usus gave me father’s amulet just to remind of our goals. I will make him proud.
7100^On the path
7101^We have taken our first step toward competing in the games. And Ludo is as serious as ever. I fear for any competitors that underestimate my tenacious friend. I could not walk this path without him. He has always been there for me and I truly appreciate him.
7102^Beginning again
7103^Now that the first battles are over, I feel like I can carry on. Although the weight of my father’s reputation will hang over me as long as I battle in Imperia, it’s a burden I will gladly bear.
7104^An unusual encounter
7105^Ludo can be such a fool for the fairer sex as his heart sometimes clouds his mind. Although it was strange for those Channelers to approach us as they did. I have never seen that before. My father often met with them, but he held a position within their order. They are a very secretive group, stepping outside the walls of their temple must mean something important.
7106^Stuck in Belfort
7107^The town of Belfort is such a backward place. It still carries the mindset of the military camp during a war, which is such an antiquated notion nowadays. I look forward to more sophisticated games and people elsewhere.
7108^Meeting Mutuus
7109^There is something about Mutuus that concerns me. He looks as if he holds a dark mystery in that furrowed brow of his. Usus does not have many enemies, so that does not bode well for the character of Mutuus. I also get the feeling that Usus knows more about him then he’s willing to share. But I feel that I should not press him about it unless absolutely necessary.
7110^In the shadow of greatness
7111^My father’s presence continues to hang over me at times. It serves me well as long as I maintain my father’s legacy of accomplishment. But there are many who are quick to point out when I do not. Sometimes I wonder if I am doing the right thing by continuing the school. My father often told me that there was more to life than the games. Is this really what he wanted me to do?
7112^Ghosts of the past
7113^My sleep has been restless ever since my father’s untimely death. But last night my dreams became very strange. Images of my father in his younger days, some from before I was even born, floated through my mind like I was there. It seems that he will always be with me, in spirit at least. Will I ever be able to live up to what he was?
7114^Watching the Caltha games
7115^The excitement of the Arena at Caltha is simply intoxicating. I can feel it rush through me, and it appears that Ludo feels the same way. He is truly impetuous. That is one thing I envy about him, although I do fear he may let his passions drive him more than he should sometimes. It seems as though he never second-guesses his decisions, which seems to be my curse at times.
7116^Heart of a warrior
7117^The impassioned beasts of Cro Beska fight with tenacity not found elsewhere. I can see Ludo feed off of it. He does not take his foes seriously enough though, which worries me. Maybe I worry about him too much; Usus does not find him careless in battle.
7118^Excess in Orus
7119^This town represents many things that I do not like about Imperia. Those rich pampered fools, who derive great pleasure from watching the suffering of others, disgust me. And the fact that they think any Affinity God would grant them special privileges in this world or any other is truly unenlightened. They do not even begin to understand the special power of the Affinities.
7120^The magical town of Syrna
7121^The splendor of Syrna never ceases to amaze me. The beautiful waters frame one of Imperia’s grandest cities. The games here hold a special place for me, as they did my father. I think the occasional appearances of the Channelers in the games add to the atmosphere, as my father would always take that opportunity to remind me of their importance.
7122^Another Channeler encounter
7123^I am now certain there is more to the Channelers than what they reveal. Though Ludo thinks they fancy our company, I truly doubt that. If there is something of my father’s service that they require, I am not sure if I can do that. They spread clues around me like flower petals, yet they seem to disappear before I can collect them in a basket and make sense of them all. What could this mean? Are they testing me?
7124^Beyond the wall
7125^It appears there is much unrest in the land of Nordagh. The memory of the Great War still hangs over the town of Roanor like a storm cloud ready to unleash its fury. If someone is trying to ignite the flames of war between our lands, it seems as if they’ve taken a first step with the robbery of the Roanor Temple. I hope and pray that this is not so.
7126^Ursula enters my life
7127^A remarkable turn of events has transpired. I have met the most intriguing woman. Her name is Ursula, a princess, daughter of Nordagh’s Barbarian King Orin II. It seems as if the Gods have tied our fates together, because she will now accompany us as we travel her land to participate in the gladiator games. I must admit that I am very happy about this. Ursula has a light within her that entices me to find out more about her. Will this happen? Not if her burly brother has anything to say about it. Thankfully, he will not be accompanying us.
7128^Seeing the northland
7129^Nordagh does not seem to be an entirely unfriendly place to Imperials. The King and others have given Usus a warm welcome. And I suppose traveling with royalty has made it easier for my team as a whole. Warmer welcomes or not, I am glad that my path has crossed with Ursula. She brings a welcome change to the school. However, I feel Ludo might not share my positive attitude toward change, especially when it has to do with the gladiator games.
7130^Wonders of Nordagh
7131^Dragon skeletons, warriors who increase in size when they get angered, there is much in Nordagh that we can learn from. It is a good test of our skills as gladiators. Ursula’s help in these matters is invaluable. I just wish Ludo would listen to her with open ears. His knack for ignoring people can really be a problem. I might have to speak with him about it. I think that I would like Ursula to stay with us beyond the games in Nordagh.
7132^Memories of a happy childhood
7133^To see Ursula light up when she set foot in the town where she grew up really warmed my heart. She is a beautiful, capable woman, but she still retains the spark and playfulness of a young girl. It is really quite remarkable. I wonder if she thinks about me as much as I do her? I have seen the way she looks at me sometimes and I feel that she might. I need to tell her before we leave Nordagh, or I may lose my chance forever.
7134^Unable to escape the past
7135^Again my mind is filled with images of my father as I sleep. It must be someone else’s memories, because I see things I have never witnessed. Or is it the haunting guilt of not living up to his name? I try every day to do what he taught me. I lead my school with honor and strength. Is it enough? Am I straying in Nordagh? Has my attention turned too much toward Ursula? Could Ludo be right? My father wanted my happiness above all else, and he definitely would not want me to feel haunted by his memory. I must not doubt myself. I am walking the path. I must be.
7136^Intriguing Ursula
7137^Ursula is certainly a most powerful warrior. In battle she can summon powers I have never seen before, not even by Channelers. The connection she feels to the Valkyrie may be much more than the childish dream Ludo thinks it is. I have read of the Valkyrie and their downfall during the Great War. I wish I knew more about them ... and more about Ursula.
7138^Sharing about the past
7139^I was finally able to talk to Ursula and tell her of my feelings and my connection to her. And she, in return, shared hers with me. My heart wanted to explode! Although what I told her was merely the snowcapped peak of the mountain of emotions I was feeling, it was a relief to share any of it with her. She listens and understands me like no other. There are things I can talk to her about that I could not even share with Ludo. And speaking of Ludo, I am distressed by how much his impatience grows. He is becoming increasingly difficult to manage. He seems determined to keep me away from Ursula. It wouldn’t be jealousy, would it? I doubt it. Ludo would not open his heart to a girl from beyond the borders of Imperia. Or maybe the problem is that I have?
7140^Return of the menace
7141^Mutuus’ behavior in Nordagh is despicable. He shames the code that the true warriors of Imperia follow. He is a boorish lout, ignorant and vile. I wished I could keep Urusla from hearing the venom that spews from his mouth. I was embarrassed of my homeland for the first time. But to see the fire he sparked in Ursula was a relief. She would not stand for his behavior any more than I would. I was happy to see that. Though Ludo also took a stand, I was a little unsure of him. His Imperial pride knows no limits, in some ways I can see a little of Mutuus in Ludo. But my childhood friend is much too smart to end up like that old warmonger.
7142^Urlan rejoins the party
7143^My heart stopped beating the moment I saw Urlan and his Nordagh soldiers stand before us. I felt that I was about to lose Ursula to her overprotective father. But it seems as if the Gods are watching over us. In a turn of fate, Urlan has joined our school to help protect his sister and not to take her back home. I am truly overjoyed. Urlan appears to be a most capable warrior as well, but I fear that he and Ludo will continue to lock horns as they did upon meeting. It is important that we continue to be successful in the games or Ludo’s heart and mind may begin to stray.
7144^The new girl
7145^We have entered the Windward Steppes now and I have found it to be a strange place. We are forced to hire the services of a local warrior to compete. We found a rather precocious female who can handle a bow unlike any other. She also seems to have a rather wicked tongue. Not that she is malicious, she just never holds back. Obviously, she’s never set foot outside of these nomadic lands.
7146^Female warriors
7147^Well, it appears our choice of archer has paid off. Eiji is fantastically talented and she has a knack for lightening the mood, which sometimes becomes heavy between Urlan and Ludo. Ursula has taken a liking to her as well. The bond of the female warriors runs strong in the Steppes. It seems Ursula has accepted the local customs here quite quickly. She is so smart ... and lovely.
7148^Welcoming Eiji
7149^Now that she is a permanent fixture in the school, Eiji should prove to be very useful as we enter the Caltha games. The strength of Ludo, Urlan, and I along with Ursula’s magic and Eiji’s deadly aim, I cannot imagine a team that could defend all that we bring to the battlefield. Now if I could only get Ludo and Urlan to work together, that would surely be something. I think Ursula could help convince Urlan, but I am not sure about the way to break through to Ludo.
7150^Mystery of the ancients
7151^I find the ruins of this town intriguing. What kind of people could build such marvels and then just disappear? The great works of Imperia will survive many millennia. The entire world will remember our people. But the Legionnaires taking part in the games here were odd indeed. I have never seen Imperials dressed so. Nor have I seen them fight with such darkness. They seemed like soldiers rather than gladiators. I would like to know who trains them to be that way.
7152^Nyphelia encounter
7153^A most alluring women approached Ludo at the games today. She was unlike any other woman here in the Steppes. I found myself drawn to look at her, as did all the men in the arena. Then she set her sights on Ludo and really locked in. Why him? Is that just the way she recruits? Her school must be a dangerous place indeed. I was glad to see Ludo come to his senses, although I would fear for any man’s safety if they were alone with that temptress. I hope Ludo realizes that.
7154^Warriors of the Wastes
7155^We faced many Amazons in some of our most recent games. They were indeed a sight to behold. There are no schools of female warriors comparable to them in Imperia. They are powerful andbeguiling. I can see why Ursula and Eiji connect with them. And that is the same reason Urlan and Ludo are a bit intimidated by them, although they would never admit to it.
7156^An alliance broken
7157^I cannot believe what has transpired today. My friend, my brother, Ludo, left our school. His patience concerning how I was running the school had expired. He is so closed minded about the games and the types of warriors that take part in them. Neither Usus nor I could ever break through to him about that. I doubt even my father, in all his wisdom, could convince Ludo to accept those from other lands as his equals. I never could understand that. It must be the memory that he carries with him about his father that never allows him to let go. I think we may be more alike than he would like to admit. I am going to miss Ludo dearly.
7158^A sky filled with arrows
7159^There were more arrows shot in one day in the games here than at all the High Tournaments of the last decade. It is marvelously challenging to face the archers of the Steppes. I am glad to mark some of their kind as teammates. Eiji proved her worth more than ever, both in battle and in keeping Urlan occupied. This allows Ursula and I to still have some time together, away the watch of her brother.
7160^Darkness on the rise
7161^Darkness on the rise
7162^In the distance we saw more of the dark cloaked Imperials and this time that devilish Sorceress was with them. I fear for the corrupted souls that she has clouded. I also wonder what her true intentions are and what are the limits of her powers? Usus does not seem to be as concerned about this. So I suppose I should follow his lead and concentrate on the matters at hand, namely the gladiator games.
7163^Another land, another warrior
7164^As we enter the fourth and final land needed to qualify for the High Tournaments it seems as if the Gods have placed another in our ranks. A powerful warrior named Gwazi has found his way into our school. He seems to be an honorable warrior, and I will not break his code nor will I distress at the inclusion of another seemingly capable gladiator to our roster. I am very interested to see him fight in the games.
7165^Ludo’s new school
7166^To my surprise it seems as if Ludo has quickly joined another school to compete in the games with. I am troubled though that it is the Imperials we came across in the Steppes. Ludo himself seems to be focused on victory before the Emperor, as he always was, but is that what the rest of these warriors have in mind? I am sad to see my good friend take up arms against me, even if it is just to compete in the games. We were always a team and a very good one at that.
7167^To my surprise it seems as if Ludo has joined another school rather quickly. I am troubled though because it is those strange Imperials that we came across in the Steppes. Ludo himself seems to be focused, as always, on victory before the Emperor. But is that what the rest of these warriors have in mind? I am sad to see my good friend take up arms against me, even if it is just to compete in the games. We have always been a team and a very good one at that.
7168^Helping an honorable man
7169^Gwazi spoke up today about something that has been troubling him, and both Ursula and I feel it is necessary to help him. It may waylay our goal of competing at Caltha, but he is an honorable man and deserves our help. It means a great deal to me that Ursula thinks this as well. Our bond seems to strengthen every day.
7170^Conversation with Eiji
7171^A strange thing happened between Eiji and me last night. She came to talk about something, but she was tongue-tied. Something I have never witnessed before with her. As she tried to talk to me, Ursula came upon us and was hit with a bolt of jealousy. I must admit that though she is quite alluring, but I have never felt anything between Eiji and myself. She has a flirty personality, but somehow I do not feel that she would be interested in me. I hated seeing Ursula so upset over nothing. However, I would like to know what it was Eiji was trying to tell me.
7172^Treachery in the desert
7173^It seems as if we all judged Gwazi wrongly. He was not the man he showed himself to be. The length at which someone would go to take us out of the games is truly remarkable. Could Ludo have somehow been involved? Who else knows that we are competing here? Are the tales of our strong record in the games making it across to other lands? If so, there may be some schools prepared for battle with us in Caltha.
7174^Headed to the High Tournaments
7175^We are now on our way to Caltha. The High Tournaments are the next step for us. I feel a bit nervous and very excited at the same time. I wish I could explain to Ursula how much it means to be to be competing here. She has done so much for me. I really feel close to her, like she is the final piece that I have been looking for to make me complete.
7176^Aftermath of the Caltha attack
7177^A most disturbing turn of events has taken place. The High Tournaments of Caltha have been turned into a bastion of death and destruction. Mutuus somehow has his hands tied to this darkness. We must act against him, as I am sure my father would have done. I am prepared to seek the guidance of the Channelers, for that is what Usus feels my father would have done. The time for me to stand tall in my father’s footsteps has arrived. I just pray I can fill this role on my own. Ursula may not be able to help me in this.
7178^Pirgos Story
7179^Pirgos has evolved from its violent beginnings to become a more sophisticated and tranquil town. Now even Channelers can often be found in and around Pirgos. The Channelers share a connection to the Affinity Gods, which allows them to harness great power in the gladiator arena. The Channelers have a grand temple hidden somewhere in the vicinity of the towns of Pirgos and Syrna.
7180^ Cro Beska Story
7181^Cro Beska is a truly unique area. The Mongrels have been able to hold onto a piece of land where many despise them. Some credit this to the Imperial Army being stretched too thin during their conquering days. While others have theorized that the Mongrels are the beneficiaries of the horrors of the Great War and now Imperials would rather be neighbors to these beasts rather than see any more bloodshed.
7182^Orus Story
7183^The locals believe that the Fire Affinity God Exuro was the one who crafted the battlefield of Exuro’s Eye. Each fiery crack or pool of lava is said to be his handiwork. It’s also legend that Exuro controls the fires that sometimes burn the gladiators and even those in the crowd. Subsequently, all who frequent the arena have a strong devotion to the Fire God, which they believe keeps them safe.
7184^Caltha Story
7185^The Arena at Caltha hosts the High Tournaments where every year a gladiator school becomes the Imperial Champions. All the people of Imperia know that the Emperor is always present to watch the High Tournaments, and the chance to be near the most powerful man in Imperia is almost as big a draw as the land’s greatest gladiator games.
7186^Trikata Story
7187^A hero from the Great War ended the practice of forcing prisoners to fight in the Bloody Halo many years ago. Ending this tradition made the gladiator games much better in Trikata and improved the town overall. This gladiator was very successful in the games at the Halo, but the shopkeeper could not remember his name.
7188^Syrna Story
7189^Channelers frequent Syrna and take part in the gladiator games from time to time. They are powerful warriors who wield the powers of the Affinity Gods in the arena, taking down many strong gladiators with a simple wave of their hands.
7190^Fliuch Story
7191^Barbarians may appear to be simple warriors but there’s much more to them, something powerful and magical. There’s a strong bond with nature in Nordagh. It’s very different to the way things are done in Imperia. There is a special connection between the most powerful of the Barbarians and the beasts of Nordagh. It is often demonstrated in battle.
7192^Roanor Story
7193^There are many stories told about the Great War in Roanor. The armies of Nordagh and Imperia fought to a standstill for many days. Thousands of lives were lost. The Affinity Gods intervened to stop the bloodshed, but it still didn’t end. Eventually, the hideous dragon form of the Dark God appeared on the battlefield and began destroying everyone there. The armies of Imperia and Nordagh united to try and defeat the Dark God. But it was only when the Affinity Gods combined their might with the legendary Valkyrie warriors that the Dark God was defeated. The temple in Roanor stands as a monument for that victory.
7194^Mördare Story
7195^The tale of Burnnye the Brittle is a sad story about a Berserker who didn’t like to fight. Everyone in his tribe would abuse him, but he never fought back. He was forced to take part in the games in Mördare’s Den and Burnnye ran and hid until the fight was over. But this made the rest of his fellow Berserkers so enraged that they quickly and easily defeated a very tough school. And so this group of Berserkers continued to compete in the games. Eventually Burnnye led his undefeated team into battle before the Barbarian King Orin the First. But the fearsome Barbarian school scared Burnnye so much that he soiled himself. Because of this embarrassment the enraged Berserkers quickly destroyed the Barbarian champions, but then turned on Burnnye and attacked him. The King’s bodyguards intervened to save Burnnye, who ran away from his Berserker tribe and hid somewhere in the forests of Nordagh. No one has heard anything from Burnnye the Brittle Berserker since.
7196^Sloan Forest Story
7197^The Galdr witches aren’t anything to worry about for the locals. But the fear of them keeps the Imperials and other unwanted travelers from ruining the great forests of Nordagh. To those who don’t respect the forests and caves of Nordagh, the Galdr are deadly opponents. They fight in the games but never use their full powers in the games. A powerful Galdr witch can see into the future. It is best for those from other lands to avoid them all together.
7198^The story of Gallyun is a tale of the most dedicated fan of Galltyr, the Valkyrie warrior princess who was the patron of the Vargen gladiator games. Originally named Verktub, this barbarian changed his name to Gallyun to be more like his Valkyrie obsession. He claimed to have seen Galltyr’s spirit smiling at him after a victory in the gladiator games. After that he spent all his time researching the Valkyrie, and Galltyr in particular. Eventually he left town to search for her spirit, which was rumored to be trapped in the world of the living. It is assumed that he starved to death in the mountains outside of Vargen, although some say differently.
7199^Vargen Story
7200^There isn’t much of town surrounding King Orin the Second’s castle. It’s a small settlement where the servants and guards and others stay in support of the royal family and the king’s court. It is one of the most pleasant and prosperous places to live all of Nordagh.
7201^Orin's Keep Town History
7202^Originally a training ground for the elite soldiers of Nordagh, Orin’s Keep is now simply a training ground gladiators during this time of peace. The arena is popular being built with plenty of seats for the crowd, many of whom come just to see the King and the royal family.
7203^Orin's Keep Arena History
7204^For hundreds of years the Barbarian Kings of Nordagh have always held a unique relationship with the Galdr witches. Galdr have been known to visit the castle from time to time. But that hasn’t happened recently because King Orin the Second has severed ties with the Galdr witches. Nobody knows exactly why, but since Orin is such a respected leader, no one doubts his reasons.
7205^Orin's Keep Story
7206^Once several Ogres traveled to Ononhaar, severely trounced the competition in the arena, and then took command of the town. For several weeks the Ogres ran the town, taking whatever they wanted and not paying for anything. It wasn’t until a brave group of archers challenged them to a final battle that this reign of terror ended. The leader of the archers, a short female, led five other archers in to the arena and took down the Ogres. The lady and her archers left Ononhaar and have not returned since.
7207^Ononhaar Story
7208^Yuset Story
7209^The lone survivor of the original beast attacks at Suren lived to be a very old and very crazy man. He spent his time telling false tales of adventure and eventually fancied himself a gladiator, although he was much to old to participate in the games. Unable to control him, the League Office had him caged outside of the arena so he would stop interfering with the games. He died within the cage.
7210^Many rumors exist about the past glory of the culture that built the Altahrun Ruins, but not have been proven as fact. There are many that doubt the greatness of a culture that was wiped out by an earthquake.
7211^Altahrun
7212^For centuries the Amazon warriors, a society made up entirely of women, has prospered without the help of men. Only a single full-grown male ever existed with the Amazons and was used to continue to bloodline of the warriors. This line of men created only female children until they became too weak to “seed” and their last child was always a man to take their place. But a strange illness killed the elderly seed barer and his young son, leaving the Amazons without a way to continue their existence. Eventually their population decreased as the leaders of the Amazons fought over how to find their next chosen one. Eventually a small group of Amazons left to find a man to help them. They encountered Shugnin, a powerful warrior who defeated them all in the games. Later they seduced him and Shugnin impregnated the entire group of Amazons, all with female children. They returned to present Shugnin and their children to the Amazon leaders. The facts could not be argued and Shugnin has been the seed barer ever since.
7213^Wastes Story
7214^There is a story of an angry prince who couldn’t wait to rule the Southern Expanse, but his father the king lived a long life, enraging the young tyrant-to-be. The prince never married since he thought that women were beneath him. He instead had many concubines. Eventually he met a beautiful woman that used her feminine charms to control him. After a while, the woman became bored and the king showed no signs of passing on, so she began to find other men to please her. Once she became pregnant, the Prince finally decided to end his relationship with her. He publicly tortured her in an attempt to kill the baby. But this mysterious beauty escaped and killed the Prince. It is rumored that she is a powerful sorceress who uses her son as a henchman.
7215^Akar An Story
7216^The Summoners of Saraa Izel are seen as bogeymen to the nearby villagers of the Soutern Expanse. There are stories of children being stolen in the night or the last breath of the elderly being sucked away by the evil magicians. Sometimes villagers come to seek revenge, but they are always frightened away by the magical might of the Summoners. So, none of the bogeymen stories ever get confirmed.

The witch said she’d be watching me. Why? What do those creatures want from me?

7522^Vargen is both an ancient and a new city. The peak of the mountain was a spiritual place for the elders of the past. Vargen was then called Varghallen, and the people there were rumored to have lived among The Gods. But ages ago, man's propensity for violence turned them against The Gods. Thus began The War of The Giants, which lasted more than a century. Giants with snakes for legs and arms were summoned by The Gods to hold the mountaintop, but the people fought back with fervor. The Gods were furious with mankind and punished them for 111 years, until man finally repented. The Gods called to the mortals to come back. They were once again welcomed to Varghallen. As the people climbed the mountain, they ascended to Heaven, guided by the light and blessings of the Valkyrie. After that, the few who remained rebuilt this city in the name of peace between Heaven and Earth. Everything that man has done since The War of the Giants has been done for the glory of The Affinity Gods. The War of The Giants is now myth and legend. All that is known in Vargen is that the people live for The Affinity Gods. Perhaps The Ancient Gods will resurface, if they exist. Until then, the people of Vargen continue to live off the land.

7524^The Fjord of The Fallen isn't a traditional arena. All of the gladiatorial combat takes place on the surface of the Gardred Lake. This lake has never thawed, although water does flow under the frozen surface supplying the town with all of its water. The Gardred Lake is the only place with enough room for gladiatorial combat, which are enjoyed by the people of Vargen just like anyone else. The arena is named The Fjord of The Fallen because it is where the War of The Giants began ages ago. Many soldiers died at the surface of the Gardred Lake. The bodies were never recovered and it is rumored that they regained life in the form of the Yeti. This is why Yeti battles are favored here in Vargen. It really is a culturally rich place, whether it’s the arena, the town, or even the people.
7525^Imperial Championship
7526^Imperial Championship League
7527^I can’t believe we beat the Falcons! I’ve watched them fight for years. We are much better than I thought.
7528^Don’t get overconfident, my young friend. There is still much to be learned about the art of the battle. A seasoned school like the Falcons will have studied much in this competition that they will use against us if we meet them again in the games.
7529^Taking down the Falcons, who appeared to be the local favorites, has not won us any fans here in Fliuch.
7530^We needn’t bother appealing to the crowds of this land. The games of Nordagh should not be a challenge for an Imperial school.
7531^You were lucky to win this time, little whelps. Face us again and you won’t be able to walk out of the arena, they’ll be dragging your corpses out!
7532^Those are pretty big words for a loser. You better hope we never take you up on that rematch, for your sake.
7533^Well it seems as if the little boys from Imperia aren’t nearly as pathetic as their fathers in the gladiator games. I hope to see you again, so my team can wipe those grins off your faces.
7534^If I ever come across you with a weapon in your hand, you foul cretin, it will be your end.
7535^I always enjoyed watching the Masters of the Glade in the games. I can’t believe we’ve bested them.
7536^We left here as mere children, but we have returned as champions of the Sloan Forest. I agree it’s pretty unbelievable, sister.
7537^Taming the beasts of this land is just as easy as defeating the hulking oafs that call themselves warriors!
7538^Ludo, your brazen tongue wins you no favor in this arena or within this school. The true warrior celebrates his victories respectfully.
7539^I am stunned at our defeat. This young school has proven themselves to be mighty indeed. It appears as if they have found fortune in the God’s eyes.
7540^We make our own fortune! But we do appreciate the compliments.
7541^Winning this tournament was quite an accomplishment; this team could stand against any in Imperia. If they ever traveled beyond the borders of Nordagh this school would surely be very successful.
7542^This is a proud area that is beholden to our heritage. We remain here by choice and will continue to do so.
7543^The warriors of the Krigare School are as tenacious as the long dead beast at the center of the arena. We should stand tall as the victors of this tournament.
7544^But you should learn a lesson from this fight, Urlan. The variety of warriors found in the Krigare School made them strong. It will serve us to follow their lead in such matters.
7545^You should all be proud, you’ve bested a well-respected school that has warriors from both Nordagh and Imperia. This was the test I was waiting for and you passed it successfully.
7546^Thank you for the kind words, Usus. It does seem as though our school continues to grow in both skill and success as we travel this land.
7547^It seems that your father was wise to put you two in the gladiator school. You have proven yourselves to the Krigare, and that is no easy task. Continue on with your success, or you’ll threaten our reputation as well as your own.
7548^Thank you for your kind words, we have no plans to stop winning now!
7549^We have proven ourselves to be better than whatever school Nordagh can throw at us here. Even at the steps of the lowly Barbarian King’s castle there is nothing that can compete with us.
7550^Contain your excitement, Ludo. Your rudeness not only offends the entire crowd watching these games, but myself as well. King Orin of Nordagh is a friend of mine. Treat him with the respect he deserves.
7551^The variety of warriors in Imperia is astounding. Many of these I have never seen in Nordagh, especially the Channelers.
7552^My land has a great many things to offer, in addition to its impressive array of warriors. Perhaps one day I will be able to show you some of it.
7553^The tournament victory here is quite a relief. With all of the Peltasts, Centurions and Channelers in these games, it is good preparation for the rest of the land.
7554^Can’t you stop thinking about the future for one moment and just enjoy a victory?
7555^It seems as if your success continues in Imperia as well. You two will make a name for yourself throughout all the lands if you continue to fight like this.
7556^I think I’d like that. I could really get used to taking part in the games. I just hope father shares that enthusiasm.
7557^Neither the beasts nor the soldiers of Belfort could stand before us. We will surely be Imperial Champions. I am as sure of that as I am of the tournament we just won.
7558^I always admire your confidence, Ludo, but I prefer it seasoned with a little pragmatism. Let us continue on competing in the games before we consider ourselves champions.
7559^I am impressed at the way you handled yourselves before the Secutors of Syrna. The upper class of the land enjoys them using their dirty tricks on those from other lands. But it appears that you had some tricks of your own that they weren’t prepared for.
7560^It’s not tricks, Master Usus. It’s skill and power. We have plenty of both in this school.
7561^Munio would have been proud to see how well the two of you handled yourselves before the Secutors of Syrna. The tricks of those warriors were not enough to best you.
7562^Thank you, Usus. I would like to think that he’s watching us in the games as well.
7563^Little girls should not be playing in our games. You were lucky this time, girly. Try fighting us again some time and we’ll let you know how Imperials treat the women of Nordagh.
7564^You should enjoy my company while you still can, you brute. You may never see me again. Seeing as we won this tournament, there’s no reason for us to return here.
7565^We’ve learned a valuable lesson with this victory; brute strength alone will not win you a tournament. It takes smarts and skills to overcome the challenges of the games.
7566^Come over here and say that, old man. I’ll show you that brute strength is enough to shut your mouth!
7567^These beasts were less imposing than whatever we would come across deep in the woods of Nordagh. They should be thankful that they live in Imperia, where the locals are scared of anyone who snarls at them. They wouldn’t last a week in the forests of my land.
7568^Then go back to your forests, barbarian. We don’t want your kind here anyway!
7569^I can’t believe these pitiful beasts have held on to this city for so long fighting like that. This victory was hardly a challenge.
7570^Come back with a legion of soldiers carrying the flag of the Emperor, pompous Imperial, and you will see the Mongrels tear them to shreds. Don’t think you’ve seen us fight until you threaten our beloved home!
7571^I never imagined that Imperia had such ferocious beasts. Facing one Minotaur in the games would be quite a challenge, let alone two.
7572^But we handled those beasts and the archers that came with them. Our school in action is truly a sight to behold.
7573^I have never witnessed such a fight as the one we faced here. It looks as if the locals of Orus have grown bored with the deadly flames of the arena. I fear for what they come up with next.
7574^As do I, Valens. The opulence and ignorance of the people here does astound me. Thankfully, we faced the worst they could conceive and came out unscathed.
7575^Well, archer, it looks as if you’ve lived up to your little performance on the streets of Yuset. You are quite good.
7576^Don’t sell me short, Usus. I’m fantastic. And you’ve just seen me in one tournament. Wait until you see what else I’m capable of doing.
7577^I am impressed by the dedication to history that the locals here have. I feel that there is much to learn in this place, as long as you talk to the right people.
7578^I’m glad to hear you say that, Valens. I feel the same way. I just wish my stubborn brother would agree.
7579^Well, boys, you made it out of the Wastes alive. Enjoy your share of the treasures from the battlefield. But we should take it and go. The Amazons do not take kindly to being defeated by a bunch of men from the valleys and forests. And if you don’t believe, wait around here for a while without Ursula and me and you’ll see.
7580^Care to wait around, Urlan? I’d kind of like to see what they’d have to say to you.
7581^What kind of a place has warriors of the undead as a final challenge? This is truly a strange land.
7582^I’m sure they’d find Imperia or Nordagh just as strange, Ursula. Shall we take one along with us to see?
7583^Enjoy your luck. Not many survive the trial by fire set forth by the statues of the Palace Ibliis. I would not press my fortune by remaining here if I were you.
7584^What manner of Channeler enjoys such atrocities? No wonder you were expelled from the Order.
7585^Each and every one of you who took part in these challenges should be proud. Although the games are a team sport throughout the other arenas, you were able to stand on your own as well.
7586^Our newly proven strength as individuals will only help us achieve more together as a team in Caltha!
7587^Feel very proud of your accomplishment here, Ursula. It is your first step into the world of the gladiator. I feel that you will become a very capable warrior.
7588^That means so much, thank you. I think I’ll like the games.
7589^I know that taking your first steps into the arena on your own without Munio were quite an ordeal. You handled yourself in a manner that would please your father very much. I know it pleased me. Let us continue on in the games. We have started down the right path.
7590^Your praise means a tremendous amount to me. We need to continue on in the games with the momentum that we started here.

7714^For ages mankind struggled with the balance between the Light and Dark Affinities. Selfish desires drive the weak and corrupt the mighty. Many times a misguided soul has been swallowed up by the Darkness and driven to violence.\r\n\r\nAs generations pass and the painful lessons learned are forgotten, Darkness rises again and again. From omnipotent kings to murderous thieves, powerful sorcerers to valiant knights, the Dark Affinity controlled many who were driven to destruction in its name. Each time one falls another rises to begin anew. \r\n\r\nAncient legend tells of an awful behemoth of Darkness, a physical embodiment of hatred built from the soldiers of its many wars throughout the ages. The story also speaks of the disappearance of this manifestation of evil. But was it merely sent back to the nether worlds to return again to build upon mankind’s next great evil? Only the tides of time can reveal the ultimate truth.

7830^Tip:  As you gain levels remember to revisit the local shops to pick up new equipment.  Having the right weapons and armor can make all the difference in battle.
7831^The King of arena combat, the pinnacle of gladiator glory, perhaps only surpassed by ascension to the kingdom of the gods.  By far the most spectacular arena in the game...  all the high tournaments are held here.  Originally commissioned by the great visionary Martimus, planning and design alone took 15 designers nearly 10 years to complete.  Final construction of this feat of engineering did not even come to completion until some 20 years after Martimus' death.  Only 3 of the original designers were still alive to witness the unveiling of their epic Masterwork.  Nearly 2000 slaves died in its making, 400 horses and several small villages also perished in its wake.  At the time, building resources were so scarce in Imperia that some say the massive campaigns of violence against Nordagh were initially motivated out of the need for more stone and wood, simply to complete the Arena.  Even with so much blood already staining the Coliseum, the populace was more than ready to support the blood spot within.  The Arena at Caltha soon became a jewel in the crown of the Imperial Empire.  With seating for over 30,000 spectators, pilgrims come from far and wide to fill this vaunted cathedral of violence.  Very Imperial in design with statues, columns and pennants.  It is truly a sight to behold.  Fighting in the arena is another matter entirely, and entry does not come easily.  Only the best gladiators in the land are even considered... and success in the Arena at Caltha amounts to far more than mere prize money...  The cheering crowd of Caltha can act as a powerful drug and many gladiators have ridden its effects to high victory.
7832^Imperial High Tournament
7833^Each year a new tournament crowns a new Grand Champion of the Imperial Games.  Gladiators and participants from all over the world come to fight.  This years tournament pits contenders against some of the most favored schools worldwide in a series challenge.

7836^Daedalus
7837^You need 6 'Battle Points' to beat this league.  Each battle is worth between 1 and 6 Battle Points.  The total points needed for a particular league can be found to the right.

7972^Flagon
7973^The bulb at the bottom of this bottle packs quite a punch when the Satyr uses this item as a weapon.  Keeping this bottle full is the key to maximum damage.
7974^Weird Reckoning
7975^Cruet
7976^This seemingly delicate bottle is cast in thick, nearly unbreakable glass.  Due to the thickness of the glass, the volume of spirits within is sub-standard to most Satyrs.
7977^Phial
7978^Peculiar Pillage
7979^Vial
7980^The Vial is typically used to keep medicinal spirits in.  The base is much too small to be a reliable container for more recreational drink, as it is too easy to spill.
7981^Heavy Bottle
7982^The Heavy Bottle is a favorite among Satyrs in battle, as the base is solid glass.  This bottle never spills.
7983^Crock
7984^Lighter than a jug, but much heavier than a bottle, this carafe holds an awful lot of mead.  Only the toughest Satyrs can polish off the spirits within.

7989^Decorated Bottle
7990^This Bottle is ribbed with sharp rings of glass.  Even without the weight of the Satyr's spirits, this bottle packs quite a punch.
7991^Canteen
7992^The Canteen is brought on long journeys by bands of Satyrs.  Useful for transporting large amounts of wine and mead, it can also double as a weapon quite easily.

8016^If you think your foreign school is tough enough to take out a Greater Plains Cat, think again.  Enter this battle if you dare.
8017^The Outcasts are a battle hardened group of travelers used to fighting gladiators from all the known regions.  Come fight them, but be sure to bring some Archers!
8018^Imperia is being invaded!  Satyrs and Minotaurs are running rampant, killing citizens left and right!  If only some heroes would step forward and help us!
8019^Imperia is being invaded again!  Satyrs and Minotaurs are running rampant, killing citizens left and right!  What's worse, they've got a Cyclops with them!
8020^Up this road lies the "Windward Steppes" are you sure you want to journey there?  It is a harsh land.
8021^This path leads to an area sacred to the High Sect... it may not be violated.
8022^This is not a journey to be taken lightly, as you sure you are ready?
8023^This area is dangerous to the unprepared.  That means you, begone!
8024^This is the first in a series of battles that span all arenas in The Expanse.  If you cannot handle this first battle, do not bother entering the rest.
8025^Don't be tempted by the beauty of the warriors in the Steppes, they are quiet dangerous.
8026^Challenge the Midclass of the Dervishes of the Royal school in Akar An!
8027^You know the answer, now go away!
8028^The Overclass of the Dervishes of Akar An is no force to be challenged by the weak at heart.  The finest warrior that The Southern Expanse has to offer will take six of your school on at once.
8029^Come back when your sure you want to take a long trip!
8030^I'm not taking passengers right now.
8031^I haul cargo and people to the "Southern Expanse."  But,  I'm not taking new passengers right now.
8032^The "Southern Expanse" is a desert land conquered by Imperia years ago.  The people there don't much like outsiders.
8033^They say the Summoners of the Expanse can call the beasts of the Titans onto the battlefield.  You sure you're up to that challenge! Ha Ha!
8034^For a small fee I can lower you to the boat below?  The Captian can take you to the "Southern Expanse" is you are ready?
8035^We are not ready to move on yet, thank you.
8036^Come, it is not time for this yet.
8037^Prove your strength against the other three regions by taking out their leader before yours falls in battle.
8038^Let's not waste time here.
8039^Immunities
8040^Immune to Charm, Stun, Freeze, Petrify, Confusion, Doom, Fear, and Root.

8114^The Hip Flask is an ideal companion whilst away from home.  Easily concealable, the Hip Flask can carry a small snifter of spirit to be savored when the Satyr needs it most.
8115^Once fully possessed with the powers of evil, Mutuus regains his youthful self and becomes the most powerful warrior in Imperia. Or so he thinks. Working with Nephilia has allowed Mutuus to receive the great gift of eternal youth, but at what price did it come? And when will he pay?
8116^Push opponent backward.
8117^I see, you have brought what I seek.
8118^Are you the man I'm supposed to deliver this tablet to?
8119^Indeed I am.  I trust that your journey was not too difficult?
8120^Um, no...  It was fine.
8121^Good.  I do know that the dunes of the Qaa Rah Desert can be punishing.  I also trust that the item Aziza gave you will be in good hands with me.  May I have it?
8122^Of course.  Here you are.
8123^Thank you.  I shall enjoy reading this text.  You don't know this language, do you?  The language written here?
8124^No, I don't.
8125^That's good.  That's good.
8126^I suppose you expect some payment for your troubles, then?
8127^If you have payment to give, yes, but you already have the tablet in your possession, so I guess that's up to you, isn't it?
8128^Heh.  Smart.  I see that you understand the way of the world.  Take what you want and give only what you no longer need.  However, whereas you no longer need this tablet,
8129^I need everything I already have.  I'm afraid I can offer you no payment.  Except to say that you've helped me...  Greatly.
8130^Now, if there's nothing more you require of me, I shall depart.
8131^Um, I don't think I need anything else.  We'll be on our way then.
8132^Goodbye.
8133^Sigi!  Sigi the Galdr?  Is that you?
8134^More enemies!?
8135^No, we were sent to find you!  Xandl sent us!?
8136^In that case, what are you waiting for?  Let’s send these Mongrels back to the forest!?
8137^Qorin!  I knew I'd find you at The Wandering Soul!
8138^Eiji!?  I'm surprised to see you!  Last I heard, you had banded with a bunch of foreigners!  What brings you back home?
8139^I was hoping we could get you to join us!  We could use your skills!
8140^How about that?  The traitor returns to ask favors...
8141^How dare you!  I'm not a traitor!
8142^You're a traitor to your land, Eiji--to your heritage!
8143^You don't understand!  I'm finally needed!  I'm finally a part of something I can believe in!
8144^Enough talk, Eiji!  If you can drop me before I drop you, I'll listen.  Until then, you better concentrate less on talking and more on fighting!

8149^This looks like the items from The Loyalist that Agamede was talking about.  If they were returned to her, she might see fit to offering the school a reward.
8150^This charm was given to Ursula by Sigi, a Galdr.  She said that when the time comes, Ursula will know what its purpose is.  This item cannot be equipped.
8151^This is the charm given to Valens by a strange man imprisoned inside the Mysterious Tablet.  He said that when the time comes, Valens will know what its purpose is.

8161^Wise, well educated and worldly, Usus has years of experience in the games.  He is often coarse in his language but cares deeply about helping young gladiators reach their potential.
8162^Citizens of Imperia spend most of their time in the fields, shops  or watching the games.
8163^Known for their toughness and work ethic, most Nordagh citizens make a living by hunting, fishing and logging.
8164^Nomadic in nature and easily bored, the Steppes citizens spend their lives wandering the plains looking for food, clothing or a lost merchant to prey on.
8165^The sun burns hot during the day making farming a virtual  impossibility.  The Expanse citizens make a living as armorers, weapon smiths and traveling merchants.
8166^Althaag
8167^Championship
8168^Found in most locations in Nordagh and occasionally in Imperia the Bear is a ferocious carnivore and extremely aggressive. These medium sized beasts love taking swipes at lighter opponents.
8169^Battle against the best classes in Imperia!
8170^Face off against the darker classes of Imperia.
8171^Bandits are adept at stopping Heavy classes. A successful attack will petrify a heavy for a short period of time.
8172^Good to see you again!  I've got some new items you might find interesting!
8173^Take a look at these items...
8174^The great Wastes of the Windward Steppes are where the nomad camp of the “Wandering Soul” makes its home. Out on the high plains, the nomads hunt and gather food and goods that they can trade with the cities of the Steppes. The Wastes are immense and uncharted. It is said that if you are found alone wandering them, the plains people will capture you and make you fight in their makeshift arena when they pitch camp. Often times, the strongest of the nomads will fight in the arena him/herself hoping to claim prize money from the bets against their odds.
8175^Battle the big cats of the Oasis.
8176^After Ludo's father was slain in fighting for his school, Munio took him in and treated Ludo as he did his own son, Valens. Ludo grew very close to Valens and they make a powerful team.
8177^Prop Smasher
8178^Destroy all of the props before the Satyrs make short work of your team.
8179^Finish Line
8180^Get past the Satyrs to demolish the barrels.
8181^Destroy all barrels to win.  Some Satyrs hide barrels.
8182^Unbreakable
8183^Steal Affinity Power from any gladiator.
8184^The Hunter's Arsenal is a natural choice for Dervishes traveling through Nordagh, as the Forester's Dagger and the Croag are weighted perfectly for their double-bladed skills.
8185^The Assassin's Necklace increases the Ambush range of any Peltast or Gungnir who wears it.
8186^Now that you both have a basic understanding of the League System you should go ahead and try out some of the local battles on your own.  We can continue our journey to other locations whenever you like, but I would advise that both of you reach <b>Level 2<b> status before we move on.  I will wait for you just outside of town, simply exit the league office and go to the <b>World Map</b> to find me.
